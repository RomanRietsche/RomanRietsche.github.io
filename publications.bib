That might sound far-fetched, but it could be the future model for purchases requiring service over time. According to research by two Wharton professors of operations and information management, Morris Cohen and Serguei Netessine, and doctoral student Sang-Hyun Kim, this new approach to service supply chains is already reshaping customer-supplier relationships in defense and aerospace contracting under the name "Performance-based Logistics" (PBL). It could have implications for certain retail sectors as well.},

In this editorial, we address some of the challenges faced in publishing design research related to AI and articulate viable pathways for publishing such work. More specifically, we highlight six major impediments, use the explosion in the state of the art for large language models to underscore these impediments, propose some pathways for overcoming the impediments, and use several example articles to illustrate how the pathways can be followed for different types of AI-related design artifacts.Funding: A. Abbasi was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [Grants 2240347 and IIS-2039915] and a Kemper Faculty Award. J. Parsons was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) [Grant RGPIN-2020-04916].},

  abstract = {Among the many factors that can elicit privacy concerns and affect privacy behavior, some are sensorial: detecting the presence of others through our senses. Human beings may be wired to react to sensorial cues and rely, in part, on them to assess the privacy ramifications of their actions. Individuals may react to sensorial cues indicating the presence of others even when those cues do not carry relevant information about likely consequences of privacy choices -- and thus, from a normative perspective, may not be expected to influence privacy concerns and resulting behaviors. In four experiments (N = 829), we examine the effect on privacy-relevant behavior (the disclosure of sensitive personal information) of four sensorial cues signaling the presence of other humans: proximity, visual, auditory, and olfactory, each signaling the presence of another person. Proximity and visual cues (Experiments 1 and 2) produced an inhibitory effect on intimate self-disclosures in an online survey -- including when that presence does not and cannot materially affect participants' risks or benefits associated with disclosure (Experiment 2). Auditory and olfactory cues (Experiments 3 and 4), however, did not. The findings point to a possible influence of sensorial (specifically, visual) cues on privacy behavior. We discuss the implications of the findings in the context of privacy and security decision making in a digital age, where physical cues human beings may have adapted to use for detection of threats may be absent, or even strategically manipulated by antagonistic third parties.},

This 2.6B parameter neural network is simply trained to minimize perplexity of the next token. We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72\% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86\% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a filtering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79\% SSA, 23\% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.},

Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.},

  abstract = {The open source movement has grown steadily and matured in recent years, and this growth has been mirrored by a rise in open source related research. The objective of this paper is to pause and reflect on the state of the field. We start by conducting a comprehensive literature review of open source research, and organize the resulting 618 peer-reviewed articles into a taxonomy. Elements of this taxonomy are defined and described. We then draw on a number of existing categorization schemes to develop a framework to situate open source research within a wider nomological network. Building on concepts from systems theory, we propose a holistic framework of open source research. This framework incorporates current research, as represented by the taxonomy, identifies gaps and areas of overlap, and charts a path for future work. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {National commissions and scholarly reports on the status of contemporary higher education have frequently been critical of the college experience; the emphasis on transmitting fixed bodies of information and a failure to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills have been cited as serious weaknesses in higher education systems. Colleges and universities have additional reasons to redevelop central pedagogies for students. Individuals need to learn at higher rates of effectiveness and efficiency than ever before because of rapidly growing bodies of relevant information and the escalation of knowledge and skill requirements for most jobs. Recent developments in computer hardware, software, and communication technologies create exciting new opportunities for the educational use of these technologies. The objective of this study is to go beyond the traditional classroom instructional modes (e.g., lectures and class discussions) to develop and evaluate computer-supported pedagogical approaches. More specifically, this study investigates whether the use of a group decision support system (GDSS) in a collaborative learning process enhances student learning and evaluation of classroom experiences. The findings of a study involving 127 MBA students indicate that GDSS-supported collaborative learning leads to higher levels of perceived skill development, self-reported learning, and evaluation of classroom experience in comparison with non-GDSS supported collaborative learning. Furthermore, the final test grades of the group of students who were exposed to GDSS-supported collaborative learning were significantly higher than those of the other group of students who participated in the experiment.

  abstract = {This article discusses a systematic approach to designing significant learning experiences, often referred to as the "backward design process," which has been popularized by Wiggins and McTighe (1998) and is included as a central feature of L. Dee Fink's model for integrated course design (Fink, 2003). The process is referred to as backward because it starts with a vision of the desired results. The design process then works backward to develop the instruction. The design choices that constitute the beginning of the process in the common model of course design would be made toward the end of the backward design process and would not drive the curriculum. This article also describes the new design model developed by Fink: integrated course design. The integrated model expands the course instructional design process by first considering the multifaceted realities of the designer's situational context. It then goes on to integrate specific learning experiences into an entire course and concludes by addressing such pragmatic matters as the messages conveyed in the course syllabus. However, this model still maintains the powerful backward design process as its core. The Wiggins and McTighe backward design process focuses more on particular lessons and units of instruction, while acknowledging the influence of national and local science education standards on decisions that are made about desired outcomes. The integrated course design process of Fink incorporates three distinct phases, each of which in turn includes at least several discrete, sequentially building steps in the design or redesign of a course. These phases are briefly described in this article. (Contains 1 table.)},

  abstract = {The authors' goal in working with university academics is to support an intellectual process of close examination of instructional decisions, making explicit the rationale and intentionality underlying those decisions. Subject matter understanding is the primary point of reference in this process. The focus of the research described here is the use of an unstructured form of concept mapping to support academics in the analysis of course content as the first step in a course design process. While some academics with whom the authors have worked have been initially skeptical about concept mapping, the large majority of them, in the end, report that they value the process and what they gained from it. The findings show that the concept mapping process provided an alternate means to rethink course content, one that highlighted relationships among concepts, encouraged a view of the course as an integrated whole, and frequently provided the occasion to make explicit the types of thinking required in the course.

  abstract = {A retrospective is a standard agile meeting practice designed for agile software teams to reflect and tune their process. Despite its integral importance, we know little about what aspects are focused upon during retrospectives and how reflection occurs in this practice. We conducted Case Study research involving data collected from interviews of sixteen software practitioners from four agile teams and observations of their retrospective meetings. We found that the important aspects focused on during the retrospective meeting include identifying and discussing obstacles, discussing feelings, analyzing previous action points, identifying background reasons, identifying future action points and generating a plan. Reflection occurs when the agile teams embody these aspects within three levels of reflection: reporting and responding, relating and reasoning, and reconstructing. Critically, we show that agile teams may not achieve all levels of reflection simply by performing retrospective meetings. One of the key contributions of our work is to present a reflection framework for agile retrospective meetings that explains and embeds three levels of reflection within the five steps of a standard agile retrospective. Agile teams can use this framework to achieve better focus and higher levels of reflection in their retrospective meetings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Effective feedback may be defined as feedback in which information about previous performance is used to promote positive and desirable development. This can be challenging as educators must acknowledge the psychosocial needs of the recipient while ensuring that feedback is both honest and accurate. Current feedback models remain reductionist in their approach. They are embedded in the hierarchical, diagnostic endeavours of the health professions. Even when it acknowledges the importance of two-way interactions, feedback often remains an educator-driven, one-way process.  LESSONS FROM THE LITERATURE  An understanding of the various types of feedback and an ability to actively seek an appropriate approach may support feedback effectiveness. Facilitative rather than directive feedback enhances learning for high achievers. High-achieving recipients undertaking complex tasks may benefit from delayed feedback. It is hypothesised that such learners are supported by reducing interruptions during the task. If we accept that medical students and doctors are high achievers, we can draw on some guiding principles from a complex and rarely conclusive literature. Feedback should focus on the task rather than the individual and should be specific. It should be directly linked to personal goals. Self-assessment as a means to identify personal learning requirements has no theoretical basis. Motivated recipients benefit from challenging facilitated feedback from external sources.  A NEW MODEL  To achieve truly effective feedback, the health professions must nurture recipient reflection-in-action. This builds on self-monitoring informed by external feedback. An integrated approach must be developed to support a feedback culture. Early training and experience such as peer feedback may over time support the required cultural change. Opportunities to provide feedback must not be missed, including those to impart potentially powerful feedback from high-stakes assessments. Feedback must be conceptualised as a supported sequential process rather than a series of unrelated events. Only this sustained approach will maximise any effect.},

  abstract = {Information systems professionals increasingly face changes in their work environment. Some of these changes are incremental, but many require fundamental shifts in mindset (referred to as a mindshift). Within the domain of software development, previous research has determined that veteran developers experience difficulty making the transition to new forms of development. Although prior research has brought awareness to the problems caused by a mindshift and has provided some insight, it has not answered the question of why software developers have difficulty making the transition. This study begins to answer that question by positing and examining the mindshift learning theory (MLT). The MLT suggests that the degree of perceived novelty of the fundamental concepts that characterize the new mindset will impact learning. Specifically, concepts may be perceived as novel (i.e., not familiar to the learner), changed (i.e., similar to a known concept, but a different meaning in the new context), or carryover (i.e., known concept with a similar meaning in the new context). As an exemplar mindshift learning situation, this study explores the phenomenon in the context of software developers transitioning from traditional to object-oriented (OO) software development. Findings indicate that software developers had higher knowledge scores on the OO concepts they perceived as novel or carryover compared to those they perceived as changed. Thus, developers experienced detrimental interference from their existing traditional software development knowledge structure when trying to learn OO software development. The findings have implications for organizations and individuals as an understanding  of mindshifts could mean an easier transition through decreased frustration and a more effective learning process.

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2-7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times-our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8-14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {Many school systems across the globe turned to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This context differs significantly from the prepandemic situation in which massive open online courses attracted large numbers of voluntary learners who struggled with completion. Students who are provided online courses by their high schools also have their behavior determined by actions of their teachers and school system. We conducted experiments to improve participation in online learning before, during, and right after the COVID-19 outbreak, with 1,151 schools covering more than 45,000 students in their final years of high school in Ecuador. These experiments tested light-touch interventions at scale, motivated by behavioral science, and were carried out at three levels: that of the system, teacher, and student. We find the largest impacts come from intervening at the system level. A cheap, online learning management system for centralized monitoring increased participation by 0.21 SD and subject knowledge by 0.13 SD relative to decentralized management. Centralized management is particularly effective for underperforming schools. Teacher-level nudges in the form of benchmarking emails, encouragement messages, and administrative reminders did not improve student participation. There was no significant impact of encouragement messages to students, or in having them plan and team-up with peers. Small financial incentives in the form of lottery prizes for finishing lessons did increase study time, but was less cost-effective, and had no significant impact on knowledge. The results show the difficulty in incentivizing online learning at scale, and a key role for central monitoring.},

This article updates our understanding of the field of feedback-seeking behavior (FSB) since this literature was last reviewed in 2003, analyzes its current state, and suggests future research ideas. We begin by positioning feedback seeking within a broader theoretical context by relating it to proactivity, impression management, and individual adjustment. We then review what we currently know about who is more likely to seek feedback, as well as the contexts that stimulate such seeking. We then review the benefits and potential costs that might accompany feedback seeking, with regard to the person who is seeking it as well as the group. We conclude this review by identifying potentially fruitful avenues for further research and some key practical implications.},

First, feedback stimulates individuals to set subsequent goals for their performance. In this way, goal setting mediates the relationship between feedback and performance. Second, feedback is thought to interact with goals such that performance is improved most when both feedback and goals are present. In this way, feedback moderates the relationship between goal setting and performance. We retain most of the nomenclature of their original chapter, but we broaden our sense of feedback beyond simply knowledge of results (typically indicative of quantitative feedback) or one's performance to also consider feedback more generally, from that existing in the environment, that available from multiple sources, that which is ambiguous as well as clear-cut, and that which is qualitative as well as quantitative.

Also, the HEXACO model predicts several personality phenomena that are not explained within the B5/FFM, including the relations of personality factors with theoretical biologists' constructs of reciprocal and kin altruism and the patterns of sex differences in personality traits. In addition, the HEXACO model accommodates several personality variables that are poorly assimilated within the B5/FFM.},

In this study, we investigated the reactions of test takers to an interactive assessment with immediate feedback and answer-revision opportunities for the two types of items. Eighth-grade students solved mathematics problems, both MC and OE, with standard instructions and feedback-and-revision opportunities. An analysis of scores based on revised answers in feedback mode revealed gains in measurement precision for OE items but not for MC items. These results are explained through the concept of effortful engagement-the OE format encourages more mindful engagement with the items in interactive mode. This interpretation is supported by analyses of response times and test takers' reports.},

Attention facilitates target processing during both perceptual and postperceptual stages of processing, and functionally dissociated processes have been implicated in the maintenance of different kinds of information in working memory. Thus, although it is clear that these processes are closely intertwined, the nature of these interactions depends upon the specific variety of attention or working memory that is considered.},

Monitoring one's own learning is a prerequisite skill for successful self-regulated learning. However, accurate monitoring has been found to be difficult for adolescents, especially for learning problem-solving tasks such as can be found in math and biology. This study investigated whether a self-explaining strategy, which has been found effective for improving monitoring accuracy in learning from text, can improve monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance in secondary biology education. In 2 experiments, one half of the participants learned to solve biology problems by studying video-modeling examples, and the other one half learned by giving step-by-step self-explanations following the video-modeling examples (Experiment 1) or by following the posttest problem-solving tasks (Experiment 2). Results showed that in contrast to earlier studies, self-explaining did not improve monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness. However, the quality of self-explanations was found to be related to monitoring accuracy and performance. Interestingly, the complexity of the problem-solving tasks affected monitoring and regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance. These results are discussed in relation to the cognitive demands that monitoring and regulating learning to solve problems combined with self-explaining pose on learners.

As technology  continues to develop, so do the number of methods to create and maintain  relationships. While speaking face-to-face (FtF) remains the primary way to  communicate, computer-mediated communication has become more common, meaning that  research into self-disclosure has expanded to new domains, including virtual  reality (VR). This study compared self-disclosure between three conversation  contexts: FtF, online text-based (OTB) communication, or VR. Zero-contact dyads  comprised female university students who completed 20-minute conversations guided  by one of two discussion prompts: the closeness-generating or small talk  procedure. These prompts were designed to either increase or not increase  self-disclosure. These conversations were recorded and coded for the frequency of  total, factual, cognitive, and emotional self-disclosures as objective measures.  Participants' perceptions of personal and partner's self-disclosures were also  assessed by questionnaires as perceived measures. FtF and VR conditions exceeded  OTB communication in perceived and objective measures of self-disclosure.  Although no significant differences emerged between FtF and VR conditions for  factual or perceived self-disclosure, participants in the FtF condition had more  total, cognitive, and emotional self-disclosures than VR conditions. Implications  for communication and teletherapy are discussed. The present study offers  preliminary evidence that VR could potentially rival FtF as a communication  medium and be as effective in facilitating self-disclosure. Findings offer a  starting point for research on social applications of VR.},

  abstract = {Abstract Researchers in academia typically perform different tasks: research, teaching and services to the scientific community. We analyze the opportunity costs in terms of a potentially reduced publication productivity associated with becoming a dean in the German institutional setting where deans are non-professional expert-leaders who temporarily take the dean position. Theoretically, we distinguish between two different effects that relate deanship and publication productivity: a resource effect where publication productivity during and---as a result of potentially having developed a taste for service---also post deanship decrease as a result of a reduction of the available time for research and a self-selection effect where pre-deanship publication productivity is lower than that of peers who are not about to become dean. Based on a dataset of 1110 business and economics researchers from German-speaking universities, we find evidence for a resource effect with leadership in academia reducing research productivity during and also post deanship. We find no evidence of a negative self-selection effect in the sense of less successful researchers being more likely to take the position of a dean. Reduced research productivity during and post deanship as compared to those researchers that never became dean is driven by those researchers who become dean in later periods of their career, i. e., presumably by those who deliberately shift their focus away from research and towards a stronger engagement in the scientific community in their late career years. Early career deans, on the contrary, seem to see their deanship more as a transitory role and are able to compensate the reduced resources during deanship, and they also do not suffer from a reduced publication productivity post deanship.},

The paper then introduces the more flexible JD-R model and discusses its basic premises. Findings The paper provides an overview of the studies that have been conducted with the JD-R model. It discusses evidence for each of the model's main propositions. The JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management. A two-stage approach can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of individuals, work groups, departments, and organizations at large. Originality/value This paper challenges existing stress models, and focuses on both negative and positive indicators of employee well being. In addition, it outlines how the JD-R model can be applied to a wide range of occupations, and be used to improve employee well being and performance.},

In causal tests, the higher the level of induced self-efficacy, the higher the performance accomplishments and the lower the emotional arousal. The different lines of research reviewed show that the SEM may have wide explanatory power. Perceived self-efficacy helps to account for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self-regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self-debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pursuits. The influential role of perceived collective efficacy in social change and the social conditions conducive to development of collective inefficacy are analyzed.

Supporting asynchronous collaboration around educational multimedia is potentially a significant tool for delivering online educational content effectively. A multimedia annotation system rightly integrated with e-mail provides a powerful platform on which to base such functionality. In this paper we describe a series of studies of such as system. First, we built a prototype annotation system and refined it based on results of laboratory tests. We then extended the system to support asynchronous collaboration for on-demand training and studied its effectiveness in two corporate training courses, assessing student experience, instructor experience, and user interface appropriateness. Having identified possibilities for enhancing engagement and collaboration with the tool, we conducted another set of laboratory studies. Through this iterative process we are creating a platform and identifying processes for its use, which enable students and instructors to exploit the advantages of asynchronous education while compensating for the reduction in face-to-face interaction.

  abstract = {Success or failure in teaching and learning is often associated with the level of expertise in individual faculty or motivation and abilities in students. Rarely do departments or the university as a whole share responsibility (Biggs, 2001). A potential gateway to change is learning teams, an abridged title for learning-oriented course design teams (McAlpine, 2002a). Learning teams are intentionally organized around course design projects that evolve over time to foster learning from experience. They provide an opportunity to deliberate on course decisions with a strategic group of people--faculty, pedagogical experts, instructional technologists, librarians, and students--for the purpose of initiating change. Learning teams represent a systematic process for linking people to new communities of practice, crossing boundaries we may not even know exist. The research context is McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Internal funding was provided to increase access to a core faculty development workshop on Course Design and Teaching (CDT). The CDT workshop is a five-day intensive experience that provides a framework for helping professors think intentionally about their instructional decisions (Saroyan \& Amundsen, 2004). A major challenge in the workshop over the years has been how to model and make explicit issues around the role of technology in instruction, and more recently information resources, while preserving the theoretical integrity of the workshop. The redesign of the CDT workshop with these goals in mind presented an opportunity to experiment formally with the learning team strategy. A learning team met for one year, generating and reflecting on the results of three design iterations. Grounded theory analysis of interviews with participants proceeded through an initial searching phase looking for variation in perspectives and dominant themes followed by focused coding and the seeking of patterns. Findings were validated through triangulation of different data sources (interviews, observations, documents, products) and two credibility checks (one with a colloquium of the learning team and another with an external consultant). Only findings validated with participants are cited. A conceptual model of learning teams emerged with a core concept captured in the phrase "a systematic way of talking to each other" and seven related concepts: context sensitivity, mutual goals, diversity, design framework, dialogue, collective self-reflection, and momentum. The model integrates literature from the fields of faculty development, university course design, and educational technology. What fundamentally happened in the learning team? A WebCT environment now houses a dynamic record of the CDT workshop. People in the Libraries are cued to how they can best inform the course design process. Team members have a deepened awareness and shared commitment to multidisciplinary collaboration. However, in concentrating on achieving explicit goals the team failed to reflect collectively on their own learning that occurred. Focusing attention on team processes provides a way forward on this research agenda. The real problem will lie in scaling out the learning team strategy. A new reality is needed in the professoriate to move people from individual responsibility to collective responsibility in university course design, not as groups of experts but as multidisciplinary teams.},

They estimate this model on data from 6831 consumers across 25 sites from eight Web site categories, using structural equation analysis with a priori and post hoc segmentation. The results show that the influences of the determinants of online trust are different across site categories and consumers. Privacy and order fulfillment are the most influential determinants of trust for sites in which both information risk and involvement are high, such as travel sites. Navigation is strongest for information-intensive sites, such as sports, portal, and community sites. Brand strength is critical for high-involvement categories, such as automobile and financial services sites. Online trust partially mediates the relationships between Web site and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent, and this mediation is strongest (weakest) for sites oriented toward infrequently (frequently) purchased, high-involvement items, such as computers (financial services).},

  abstract = {This qualitative research project is the study of a group of University of North Dakota (UND) faculty who developed and are teaching an innovative interdepartmental, transdisciplinary, pre-service early intervention course and the students who have taken the course. The purpose of this research was to study the perceptions of the faculty and students regarding their experiences with the course. The study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the dynamics within the faculty collaboration that have led to the success and longevity of this course, and (2) How did this happen and why has it lasted? The answers to these questions became the focus of the final data analysis. The data collection took place over a six year period. The data collected were from multiple sources and included student and faculty interviews, student journals, course evaluations, faculty meeting notes and summaries, faculty written communications, and the researcher's personal notes and reflections. Themes, based on the faculty interviews, were developed through a process of coding and categorizing the data. The interview transcriptions were coded with frequently occurring key concepts. The codes and supporting data were grouped and collapsed into the categories. The categories were then used to develop the two themes that emerged from the analysis of the data. The themes are also supported by the other data that were collected. Two themes emerged from the data analysis: Positive aspects/outcomes appear to supercede the negative influences/barriers. The relational dynamics between the faculty have had a positive influence on the development of the course. The themes and supporting data led the researcher to form the following conclusions: (1) The opportunity to be creative, the positive outcomes, open communication, and sense of fulfillment, all factors that help overcome the negatives/barriers, are what help keep the commitment strong. (2) The faculty all have a strong commitment, a passion for, the course model and content. (3) The faculty have become a support system for each other both professionally and personally.},

Specifically, tailoring of the scrum master role is investigated. The scrum master acts as a facilitator for software development teams, nurturing adherence to agile practices and removing impediments for team members. But in large projects, scrum masters often work together in geographically distributed teams. Scrum masters use sprint planning to avoid development tasks that overlap team boundaries, coordinate status and effort across teams, and integrate code bases. The study comprises 8 international companies in London, Bangalore and Delhi. Interviews with 46 practitioners were conducted between February 2010 and May 2012. A grounded theory research method was used to identify that the scrum master role comprises six activities: process anchor, stand-up facilitator, impediment remover, sprint planner, scrum of scrums facilitator, and integration anchor. This systematic description of activities in scrum master teams extends our understanding of practitioner perspectives on agile process tailoring in large enterprises. Understanding these activities will help coaches guide large scale agile teams.},

Organizations struggle to implement practical approaches due to the lack of concrete prescriptions. We performed a literature review to identify OL approaches and linked these approaches to OL theories. We synthesized 18 OL approaches across three domains: people (seven approaches), processes (nine), and technologies (two). Furthermore, we suggest two directions for future research: referring to the evaluation of our results and addressing the contingencies of OL effectiveness. Our mapping guides organizations in the design of learning processes to improve long-term performance. Although relying on a single approach is unlikely to comprehensively enable OL, our mapping facilitates the combination of several approaches aligned with organizational culture and processes.},

  abstract = {Designed to stimulate course planning teams to consider a wide range of technological options at the start of the course design process, this paper focuses on ways in which technology can be used to design, produce, and present European-wide distance education courses. The more detailed objectives of the paper are to look at how technology may facilitate the joint production of courses across different institutions in different countries; speed up course production; help in the delivery of courses to different target groups in different countries; and suggest prototype course designs that meet the challenge of the first three objectives and might attract some external funding. Factors to be considered in determining the suitability of technology for distance teaching are then considered, including access and availability to students, costs, teaching functions, interaction and user-friendliness, organizational constraints, and novelty. Scenarios for media use in European courses are also suggested; these include electronic publishing, videocassette courses, tutored video instruction, computer-mediated communication, and computer-based learning with videodiscs. The paper concludes by identifying several policy issues that need to be resolved by the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities before final choices can be made about the use of technology in European-wide courses.

  abstract = {Purpose-- The paper seeks to show that self-determination is a widely regarded motivational variable in educational research that relates to intrinsically motivated, self-directed learning at work. This study aimed to find out whether the possibility to provide upward feedback to supervisors contributes to employees' feelings of self-determination. This should only be the case if the subordinates perceive the possibility to provide feedback as a serious possibility of influence and improvement.Design/methodology/approach-- The paper finds that in a cross-sectional case study, 76 employees from a high-tech industry enterprise were surveyed for their perception of upward feedback and their feeling of self-determination by questionnaire. Self-determination was measured by the support of the intrinsic needs of autonomy, competence and social relatedness at the workplace.Findings-- The paper finds that, as expected, the perceived quality of the upward feedback is related positively to self-determination. Employees who perceive the upward feedback as a chance for improving their working conditions also perceive more support of autonomy, competence and social relatedness at their workplace.Research limitations/implications-- In the paper the correlative design allows no conclusions about the direction of causality between the perceived quality of the upward feedback and self-determination. Further, due to the design the results are limited to the specific field.Originality/value-- The paper delivers a new aspect of the role of feedback for learning in organisations by casting light on beneficial effects for the provider of the feedback, not the receiver. It emphasises the role of empowerment and participation for establishing an organisational climate that fosters motivation and learning, and shows the possible contribution of upward feedback in this process.},

Such a quantum channel can be used in conjunction with ordinary insecure classical channels to distribute random key information between two users with the assurance that it remains unknown to anyone else, even when the users share no secret information initially. We also present a protocol for coin-tossing by exchange of quantum messages, which is secure against traditional kinds of cheating, even by an opponent with unlimited computing power, but ironically can be subverted by use of a still subtler quantum phenomenon, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.}

Managing AI involves communicating, leading, coordinating, and controlling an ever-evolving frontier of computational advancements that references human intelligence in addressing ever more complex decisionmaking problems. It means making decisions about three related, interdependent facets of AI--autonomy, learning, and inscrutability--in the ongoing quest to push the frontiers of performance and scope of AI. We demonstrate how the frontiers of AI have shifted with time, and explain how the seven exemplar studies included in this special issue are helping us learn about management at the frontiers of AI. We close by speculating about future frontiers in managing AI and what role information systems scholarship has in exploring and shaping this future.

  abstract = {Traditional interventions for academic procrastination often fail to capture the nuanced, individual-specific factors that underlie them. Large language models (LLMs) hold immense potential for addressing this gap by permitting open-ended inputs, including the ability to customize interventions to individuals' unique needs. However, user expectations and potential limitations of LLMs in this context remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with 15 university students and 6 experts, during which a technology probe for generating personalized advice for managing procrastination was presented. Our results highlight the necessity for LLMs to provide structured, deadline-oriented steps and enhanced user support mechanisms. Additionally, our results surface the need for an adaptive approach to questioning based on factors like busyness. These findings offer crucial design implications for the development of LLM-based tools for managing procrastination while cautioning the use of LLMs for therapeutic guidance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Giving and receiving feedback that changes performance is influenced significantly by the clinical learning environment. This environment is multi-dimensional but includes both organizational and feedback specific dimensions.  OBJECTIVE  The objectives of this research were to investigate the relationship between residents' perceptions of residency program culture and feedback culture; and whether there were differences in resident perceptions of their programs' and feedback cultures based on their disciplines and institution. We hypothesized that residents preferred certain program culture types and that certain aspects of a residency program's culture were related to the feedback culture.  DESIGN  Residents from six specialties at three institutions voluntarily completed two validated survey instruments (Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument [OCAI] and Feedback in Medical Education [FEEDME]-Culture survey) to assess the residency program and feedback cultures, respectively. Descriptive statistics were calculated and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data.  RESULTS  The overall response rate was 37.9\% (116/306 residents). 'Clan' culture was both the current and preferred culture by 49.3\% and 56.8\%, respectively, of the residents overall. There were differences across programs with more current 'clan' culture in pediatrics than in surgery (P = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed the Hierarchy Now culture type was significantly related to the feedback culture mean score (p = {$<$}.01). For every one unit increase in the Hierarchy Now culture type, the FEEDME-Culture mean score decreases by 0.023 units.  CONCLUSIONS  The findings of this study add to the literature by describing residents' preferences of their residency program's culture, and providing insights into the interplay between the residency program and feedback cultures.},

  abstract = {Knowing how to manage one's own learning has become increasingly important in recent years, as both the need and the opportunities for individuals to learn on their own outside of formal classroom settings have grown. During that same period, however, research on learning, memory, and metacognitive processes has provided evidence that people often have a faulty mental model of how they learn and remember, making them prone to both misassessing and mismanaging their own learning. After a discussion of what learners need to understand in order to become effective stewards of their own learning, we first review research on what people believe about how they learn and then review research on how people's ongoing assessments of their own learning are influenced by current performance and the subjective sense of fluency. We conclude with a discussion of societal assumptions and attitudes that can be counterproductive in terms of individuals becoming maximally effective learners.},

This paper aims to offer such a rationale, within a framework which can also unify the diverse set of practices which have been described as formative. The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.},

  abstract = {Chatbots allow to interact with machines in a natural language dialog. Especially in digital work environments, they offer potential for a more intuitive human-computer interaction and remove the need for artificial user interfaces, which users have to learn to operate. However, chatbots typically have to be configured with knowledge about the use case at hand, potential dialog paths, and user interactions, which means to explicitly define user input and chatbot response. The interplay between human and machine defines the perceived user experience. In this chapter, we describe our approach to develop dialogs for chatbot interaction. We use and adapt the Interaction Room Method for this purpose and introduce necessary elements to define required components, especially utterances, intents, and entities.},

For dispersed organizational teams, they represent a viable collaboration environment in which users can integrate different communication channels and manipulate digital artifacts that represent actual team deliverables. In this editorial to the Special Issue on Team Collaboration in Virtual Worlds, we discuss past research and highlight key findings with respect to five dimensions of collaborative work: technology, people, information, process, and leadership. We conclude with a discussion of the key research challenges that lie ahead to shape the research agenda for team collaboration in virtual worlds and metaverses. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The online peer assessment can contribute to reduce this workload and, possibly, to improve learning quality by assigning the assessment task to students. However, this raises the question of validity. In order to study this question, we carried out an experiment of online peer assessment in which 242 students, enrolled in 3 different courses, took part. The results show that peer assessment is equivalent to the assessment carried out by the professor in the case of exams requesting simple calculations, some mathematical reasoning, short algorithms, and short texts referring to the exact science field (computer science and electrical engineering).]},

We test small scale versions of the model in simulation and find that the expected quadratic speedup compared to the classical implementation used at Deutsche B{\textbackslash}"orse Group can be realized. Full scale production usage would be possible with less than 200 error corrected qubits. Our quantum algorithm introduces unitary but imperfect oracles which use Quantum Amplitude Estimation to detect and mark states. This construction should be of general interest and we present theoretical results regarding the performance of Grover's search algorithm with imperfect oracles.},

Negative reactions and perceptions that feedback was less accurate were related to beliefs that the feedback was less useful. Those who found feedback less useful were perceived by a facilitator as less development-focused. Goal orientation did not moderate the relationship between ratings and perceptions of accuracy or reactions to feedback. Goal orientation was related to perceptions of usefulness of the process several weeks after receipt of feedback.

GSS research results on meeting satisfaction are conflicting, reporting positive, negative, or no effects. Unfortunately, no causal model of meeting satisfaction has been developed that could explain these effects. This paper derives satisfaction attainment theory (SAT), a causal model of meeting satisfaction. It further presents a survey instrument for measuring the constructs in the model. This instrument was statistically validated with a field study involving 156 working professionals. Furthermore, the field study provided support for the hypotheses that were derived from SAT's propositions. A number of implications for future GSS research on meeting satisfaction are identified.},

Results indicated that the role-clarifying effects of feedback inquiry and monitoring were contingent rather than independent. Role clarity increased as the combination of inquiry and monitoring increased. Furthermore, these joint effects were moderated by self-efficacy, such that high-self-efficacy employees were able to effectively use the combination of inquiry and monitoring to clarify role expectations, whereas low-self-efficacy employees were not.

Two studies examine the factor structure of reactions and their nomological network. In Study 1, 178 undergraduate and 101 graduate students listened to a computer-delivered multimedia lecture. Results suggest that (a) reactions can be conceptualized as hierarchical, with overall satisfaction explaining associations among distinct reaction facets (enjoyment, relevance, and technology satisfaction), and (b) reactions are predicted by trainee characteristics. In Study 2, 97 undergraduates experienced the same lecture in 1 of 3 randomly assigned delivery technologies. Reactions were influenced by technology and were related to learning process (engagement) and outcomes (intentions regarding delivery technology, content, and learning). Both studies support the theoretical framework proposed.},

However, little is known about how students' conceptions of feedback relate to students' self-regulated learning and self-efficacy beliefs and academic performance.  AIMS  This study explores student beliefs about the role and purpose of feedback and the relationship of those beliefs to self-reported self-regulation and self-efficacy, and achievement.  SAMPLE  A total of 278 university students in a general education course on learning theory and approaches in a research-intensive university.  METHODS  Self-reported survey responses for students' conceptions of feedback (SCoF), self-regulation (SRL), academic self-efficacy (ASE), and Grade Point Average (GPA) were evaluated first with confirmatory factor analysis and then interlinked in a structural equation~model.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS  Three SCoF factors predicted SRL and/or GPA. The SCoF factor 'I use feedback' had positive associations with SRL ({$\beta~$}=~.44), GPA ({$\beta~$}=~.45), and ASE ({$\beta~$}=~.15). The SCoF factors 'tutor/marker comments' and 'peers help' both had negative relations to GPA ({$\beta~$}=~-.41 and -.16, respectively). 'Peers help' had a positive connection to SRL ({$\beta~$}=~.21). ASE itself made a small contribution to overall GPA ({$\beta~$}=~.16), while SRL had no statistically significant relation to GPA. The model indicates the centrality of believing that feedback exists to guide next steps in learning and thus contributes to SRL, ASE, and increased GPA.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.}

We explain how feedback is inherent in and a prime determiner of processes that constitute SRL, and review areas of research that elaborate contemporary models of how feedback functions in learning. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a model of self-regulation based on contemporary educational and psychological literatures. Then we use that model as a structure for analyzing the cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, and for interpreting and integrating findings from disparate research traditions. We propose an elaborated model of SRL that can embrace these research findings and that spotlights the cognitive operation of monitoring as the hub of self-regulated cognitive engagement. The model is then used to reexamine (a) recent research on how feedback affects cognitive engagement with tasks and (b) the relation among forms of engagement and achievement. We conclude with a proposal that research on feedback and research on self-regulated learning should be tightly coupled, and that the facets of our model should be explicitly addressed in future research in both areas.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compile best practices that instructional design experts implement when designing outcomes-based performance assessments and to explore instructional design processes that lead to reliable and effective performance assessments for learners. The research problem identified that there is a need to determine what constitutes effective best practices in designing performance assessments and to determine consensus on instructional design elements that are necessary for designing performance assessments. A pilot study was conducted with 5 expert participants to validate the instrument used in the first round of the study. The Delphi Technique was implemented to collect information from a panel of 12 instructional design experts in higher education. The findings in this research study determined ten best practices and instructional design elements summarized as defining the outcomes that would demonstrate competency; perform a complete cognitive analysis of the assessment; assessment methods should align with instructional context, techniques, and goals; an assessment task must be a direct measure of the outcome; the task should be clear, precise, and measureable; performance requires application and other higher order thinking skills; tasks should be contextual or relevant to the real world; criteria for evaluation should be explicitly explained; criteria can be clarified using work examples; consider learner characteristics, prior knowledge, and skills for the course; analyze targeted learner needs for the learning; offer learners with choices or allow personalized solutions; and, after the performance, learners are provided with descriptive feedback. Among the findings were that several panel members implemented course design models focused on outcomes, performance assessment, criteria, and feedback as intended during their design process. Consensus was achieved in all areas of this research study, which may prove useful to the instructional design profession. Furthermore, the course design process detailed in the themes of the study is indicative of a shift in the use of a constructivist approach to the design of assessments. The findings in this research study suggest that experts in instructional design support a constructivist approach to assessment, which is evident in the design process for assessments.},

Typical goals of ARS questions are discussed, as well as methods of compensating for the reduction in lecture time that typically results from their use. Examples of ARS use occur throughout the literature and often detail positive attitudes from both students and instructors, although exceptions do exist. When used in classes, ARS clickers typically have either a benign or positive effect on student performance on exams, depending on the method and extent of their use, and create a more positive and active atmosphere in the large classroom. These systems are especially valuable as a means of introducing and monitoring peer learning methods in the large lecture classroom. So that the reader may use clickers effectively in his or her own classroom, a set of guidelines for writing good questions and a list of best-practice tips have been culled from the literature and experienced users.},

  abstract = {Historically, information systems (IS) researchers have questioned which research paradigms, activities, and methods IS research should follow. In this paper, we argue that different research methods and activities may interact with each other, different research paradigms may complement each other due to such interactions, and therefore, a multimethodological, cross-paradigm research approach may result in better IS research than a singular approach. Three existing multimethodological IS research frameworks are reviewed and summarized into an integrated approach. Two types of interactions between different research methods across system evaluation and theory testing research activities are identified. A three-year research study about a computer-based training system for deception detection (Agent99 Trainer) provides a concrete example to demonstrate the existence and research benefits of these two types of interactions, as well as the benefits of a multimethodological, cross-paradigm IS research approach.

A critical issue in higher education is the effective implementation of assessment with the core purpose of promoting productive student learning. This edited collection provides a state-of-the-art discussion of recent, cutting-edge work into assessment for learning in higher education. It introduces a new theme of scaling up, which will be welcomed by theorists, researchers, curriculum leaders and university teachers, and showcases the work of leading figures from Australia, England, continental Europe and Hong Kong. The work illuminates four key elements: (1) Enabling assessment change; (2) Assessment for learning strategies and implementation; (3) Feedback for learning; (4) Using technology to facilitate assessment for learning. Solidly research-based and carrying important implications for enhanced practice in assessment for learning at the university level, it is a must read for academic developers, researchers, university teachers, academic leaders and all those interested in assessment matters},

  abstract = {This book introduces readers to the field of conformance checking as a whole and outlines the fundamental relation between modelled and recorded behaviour. Conformance checking interrelates the modelled and recorded behaviour of a given process and provides techniques and methods for comparing and analysing observed instances of a process in the presence of a model, independent of the model's origin. Its goal is to provide an overview of the essential techniques and methods in this field at an intuitive level, together with precise formalisations of its underlying principles. The book is divided into three parts, that are meant to cover different perspectives of the field of conformance checking. Part I presents a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the essential concepts used to interrelate modelled and recorded behaviour. It also serves as a reference for assessing how conformance checking efforts could be applied in specific domains. Next, Part II provides readers with detailed insights into algorithms for conformance checking, including the most commonly used formal notions and their instantiation for specific analysis questions. Lastly, Part III highlights applications that help to make sense of conformance checking results, thereby providing a necessary next step to increase the value of a given process model. They help to interpret the outcomes of conformance checking and incorporate them by means of enhancement and repair techniques. Providing the core building blocks of conformance checking and describing its main applications, this book mainly addresses students specializing in business process management, researchers entering process mining and conformance checking for the first time, and advanced professionals whose work involves process evaluation, modelling and optimization.},

  abstract = {Requirements elicitation (RE) is a critical phase in information systems development (ISD), having significant impacts on software quality and costs. While it has remained a key topic of interest for IS researchers, a review of the existing literature suggests that there are very few studies examining how the social process associated with RE unfolds. Prior literature acknowledges that this process involves collaboration between RE participants (e.g., user-reps and systems analysts) where knowledge regarding the system requirements is shared, absorbed, and co-constructed, such that shared mental models of the requirements can form. However, collaboration and knowledge sharing within the RE process has been characterized as tenuous in the literature, given that the groups of RE participants bring very different kinds of knowledge into this activity, and trust among the two parties cannot be guaranteed at any point. Despite acknowledgement of the tenuous nature of RE, we are not aware of research that has attempted to present an integrated view of how collaboration, knowledge transfer, and trust influence the RE process. Using data from two different organizations and adopting a grounded approach, this study presents an integrative process model of RE. The study's findings suggest that RE is composed of four different collaborative states. The study elaborates on the four states, and identifies important factors that tend to trigger transitions from one state to another. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Societal events - such as natural disasters, political shifts, or economic downturns - are time-varying and impact the learning potential of students in unique ways. These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education. Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences. To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses; (2) multilevel models; and (3) person-specific network models, (e.g., group iterative multiple model estimation; GIMME). For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election - a period of heightened sociopolitical stress - and strengths and limitations are considered. The paper ends with recommendations for future research, especially for intensive longitudinal studies of online education during COVID-19.},

  abstract = {While technology adoption is a major stream of research in information systems, few studies have examined the antecedents and consequences of mandatory adoption of technologies. To address this gap, we develop and test a model of mandatory citizen adoption of an e-government technology. Based on a framework that outlines the key stages associated with the launch of technology products, we identify various external factors as antecedents of four key technology adoption variables from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), i.e., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which ultimately impact citizen satisfaction. The four stages of technology launch and the salient antecedents in each stage are: (1) market preparation stage-awareness; (2) targeting stage-compatibility and self-efficacy; (3) positioning stage-flexibility and avoidance of personal interaction; and (4) execution stage-trust, convenience, and assistance. We test our model in a two-stage survey of 1,179 Hong Kong citizens, before and after they were issued a mandatory smart card to access e-government services. We find that the various factors tied to the different stages in launching the technology predict key technology adoption variables that, in turn, predict citizen satisfaction with e-government technology. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for governments implementing technologies whose use by citizens is mandated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Virtual worlds (VWs) are media-rich cognitively engaging technologies that geographically dispersed organizations can use as a cost effective workplace collaboration tool. Using an information processing decision making perspective and building on unique characteristics of VWs, this paper proposes a nomological net for adaptive use intention (AUI) of VWs for workplace collaborations. AUI implies intention to use a technology in a setting different from the one for which it was initially designed. We study the AUI of VWs as a workplace collaboration tool which were originally conceived as recreational gaming platforms. Decision-making literature directs us to reduction of perceived cognitive burden and minimization of risk as the two key motivations for VWs' AUI. Building on these motivations, the paper identifies cognitive absorption and user trust in VWs as the mechanisms leading to individual-level AUI decision. Drawing on social cognitive theory and literature on trust, the proposed model not only re-specifies the concept of cognitive absorption in the context of VWs but also relates it to the level of trust and usage intention for VWs. We empirically tested the proposed model via data collected from 197 VW users in Singapore. Results demonstrate the significant roles that cognitive absorption' and user trust play in VW's usage as a collaboration tool. Further, through a series of post-hoc analyses, we demonstrate the imperative need for considering both cognitive absorption and user trust together in the proposed research model for theoretical parsimony. We also discuss implications for research and practice emerging out of this study. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The purposes were to identify and examine models in California of institutional support for distance teaching faculty, and to garner information about practices that this researcher may present to colleges and universities in Taiwan as possible practices that can be emulated in Taiwanese institutions of higher learning. Through the literature, several important factors were identified, including technology training for faculty, need for faculty expertise in instructional design, alternative teaching strategies, and compensation for distance educators. Through an Internet search and questionnaire, Rio Hondo College, Loma Linda University, and California State University, Dominguez Hills were determined to be three best practice local institutions for distance teaching faculty. Interviews were conducted in each of these institutions to determine best-practices processes. These processes are: recruiting appropriate faculty, promoting awareness of distance-teaching opportunities, training faculty, providing faculty feedback, and compensating faculty. Based on the results of this study, recommendations to Taiwanese higher education institutions for establishing and maintaining distance education programs are: (1) Determine the goals and values of the program. (2) Recruit appropriate faculty with departmental participation. (3) Establish a faculty development committee to determine training and compensation needs. (4) Focus training on technology, instructional design, and teaching strategies. (5) Modify training annually as needed. (6) Support off-campus conference attendance to enable a global view. (7) Provide feedback to faculty. (8) Provide reasonable compensation to faculty. (9) Evaluate faculty satisfaction with support services. (10) Engage in continuing research. Recommendations for future research: (a) gather data from both students and faculty regarding distance education, and (b) investigate best practices in institutions throughout the United States not just in one State.},

Most hypothesized relationships among these constructs received support when tested on 2 samples, when examining different performance episodes, and when using different goal orientation and state-anxiety measures. In general, state-like individual differences were found to mediate the relationships between trait-like individual differences and learning performance.

We believe that reactions to the feedback environment provide a key explanatory mechanism linking the environment to outcomes. The present study replicates and tests a framework for understanding the feedback environment, predicting outcomes such as engagement, embeddedness, and feedback-seeking behaviors through reactions to the feedback environment. We also consider feedback orientation, defined as an individual's overall receptivity to feedback, to have a strengthening effect on the proposed relationships. Using 253 executive MBA students from 37 countries, results show significant mediational relationships in which the feedback environment influences embeddedness, engagement, and inquiry-feedback seeking through reactions to the feedback environment. Discussion of implications for engagement, embeddedness, and feedback-seeking behaviors follow.},

Here, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four diverse tasks: 1) solving math problems, 2) answering sensitive/dangerous questions, 3) generating code and 4) visual reasoning. We find that the performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time. For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers (accuracy 97.6\%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions (accuracy 2.4\%). Interestingly GPT-3.5 (June 2023) was much better than GPT-3.5 (March 2023) in this task. GPT-4 was less willing to answer sensitive questions in June than in March, and both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes in code generation in June than in March. Overall, our findings shows that the behavior of the same LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLM quality.},

However, criticisms have long been leveled at this mechanism, mostly because of its poor efficiency and low reproducibility. Recent years have seen the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting the peer review process. Nonetheless, with the involvement of humans, such limitations remain inevitable. In this paper, we propose the concept and pipeline of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) and review the relevant literature and technologies of achieving a full-scale computerized review process. On the basis of the review and discussion, we conclude that there is already corresponding research and preliminary implementation at each stage of ASPR. We further look into the challenges in ASPR with the existing technologies. The major difficulties lie in inadequate data, imperfect document parsing and representation, defective human\${\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}\$computer interaction, and flawed deep logical reasoning. Moreover, we point out the future directions and discuss the possible moral and ethical issues of ASPR. In the foreseeable future, ASPR and peer review will coexist in a reinforcing manner before ASPR is able to fully undertake the reviewing workload from humans.},

  abstract = {Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53\% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84\% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10\% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.},

Although logically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought, prior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid demonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not inform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to more errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and negative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language model reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach provides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to reason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes. To improve generalization, we introduce an automatic method to construct contrastive demonstrations. Our experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that contrastive chain of thought can serve as a general enhancement of chain-of-thought prompting.},

This research integrates the IS success model and fairness theory to construct a model for investigating the motivations behind learners' intentions to continue using Web-based learning. Our model theorizes that the three dimensions of quality (i.e. information, system and service) and the three dimensions of fairness (i.e. distributive, procedural and interactional) affect learners' satisfaction. We also argue that satisfaction and the three dimensions of fairness will influence learners' intention to continue using Web-based learning. The hypothesized model is validated empirically using data collected from 289 learners of a Web-based learning service. The results show that information quality, system quality, system use, distributive fairness and interactional fairness exhibit significant positive effects on satisfaction. Also, procedural fairness and satisfaction play significant roles in shaping learners' intention to continue using Web-based learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

We propose a theoretical model to examine whether VC attachment and satisfaction can have different effects on the two types of citizenship behaviors in VCs. Drawing on the "self-concept" as noted in marketing literature, we identify three needs to be fulfilled in order to establish the VC-self connection and model them as the antecedents of VC attachment and satisfaction. We empirically test the model with data collected from 196 users of a professional VC. The results indicate that VC attachment plays a more important role in explaining citizenship behaviors directed toward the VC and that satisfaction plays a more important role in explaining citizenship behaviors directed toward individuals. In addition, the three aspects of the self-concept are associated with members' VC attachment and satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings.},

Using data from 194 supervisor-subordinate dyads in South Korea, we conducted multiple regression analyses to test our hypotheses. The results showed that, whereas subordinates' cognition-based trust in supervisors positively influenced their FSB through increasing the perceived value of feedback received from supervisors, their affect-based trust in supervisors positively influenced their FSB through decreasing the perceived value of FSB. Additionally, we found that, when subordinates had high levels of learning goal orientation, the increasing influence of cognition-based trust on the value of feedback was stronger; in contrast, when subordinates had low levels of performance goal orientation, the decreasing influence of affect-based trust on the cost of FSB was stronger. The theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed.},

  abstract = {Group polarization is the tendency of people to become more extreme in their thinking following group discussion. It may be beneficial to some, but detrimental to other, organizational decisions. This study examines how computer-mediated communication (CMC) may be associated with group polarization. Two laboratory experiments were carried out. The first experiment, conducted in an identified setting, demonstrated that removal of verbal cues might not have reduced social presence sufficiently to impact group polarization, but removal of visual cues might have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group polarization. Besides confirming the results of the first experiment, the second experiment showed that the provision of anonymity might also have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group polarization. Analyses of process data from both experiments indicated that the reduction in social presence might have increased group polarization by causing people to generate more novel arguments and engage in more one-upmanship behavior. Collectively, process and outcome data from both experiments reveal how group polarization might be affected by level of social presence. Specifically, group discussion carried out in an unsupported setting or an identified face-to-face CMC setting tends to result in weaker group polarization. Conversely, group discussion conducted in an anonymous face-to-face CMC setting or a dispersed CMC setting (with or without anonymity) tends to lead to stronger group polarization. Implications of these results for further research and practice are provided.

Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip fabrication alongside the increasing size of datasets is motivating a growing number of researchers to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum computation to speed up classical ML algorithms. Here we review the literature in quantum ML and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical ML and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems in ML are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical questions, such as how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be addressed.},

  abstract = {Attention control is central to many models of emotion. Among the most common measures of attention, control is the Attention Control Scale (ACS), which has exerted considerable influence in terms of the volume and breadth of research findings, with its use in cognitive-experimental research continuing to increase in recent years. However, there are growing concerns about whether the ACS genuinely indexes attention control. The present paper considers the context and development of the ACS, reviews and meta-analyses the available evidence regarding its association with objective measures of attention control. Meta-analytic results from nine studies (total n\,=\,1274) indicated that the full-scale ACS was not significantly associated with behavioural measures of attentional control (r\,=\,.067, p\,=\,.093, N\,=\,1274, 95\% CI: -.011, .145). Findings indicated likely missing studies with lower correlations suggesting the true association may be smaller. Limited evidence of shared variance between subjective and objective measures of attention control contrasts with considerable evidence that the scale is closely correlated with dispositional traits (e.g. anxiety, agreeableness) that could plausibly influence responding. Thus, on the balance of current findings, we conclude that there is little compelling evidence that responding on the ACS reflects genuine attention control abilities.},

The present authors examined the effects of experimentally manipulated personality feedback that they--in the guise of therapists--e-mailed to participants on the degree of their acceptance of the feedback. Consistent with Self-Verification Theory (W. B. Swann Jr., 1987), participants accepted feedback that was consistent with their self-views more readily than they did feedback that was inconsistent with their self-views. Furthermore, the authors found main effects for therapist's status and participant's attitude toward therapy. Significant interactions showed effects in which high-status therapists and positive client attitudes increased acceptance of self-inconsistent feedback, effects that were only partially mediated by clients' perceptions of therapist competence. The present results indicate the possibility that participants may be susceptible to self-concept change or to self-fulfilling prophecy effects in therapy when they have a positive attitude toward therapy or are working with a high-status therapist.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Health professionals are increasingly expected to identify their own learning needs through a process of ongoing self-assessment. Self-assessment is integral to many appraisal systems and has been espoused as an important aspect of personal professional behaviour by several regulatory bodies and those developing learning outcomes for clinical students. In this review we considered the evidence base on self-assessment since Gordon's comprehensive review in 1991. The overall aim of the present review was to determine whether specific methods of self-assessment lead to change in learning behaviour or clinical practice. Specific objectives sought evidence for effectiveness of self-assessment interventions to: a. improve perception of learning needs; b. promote change in learning activity; c. improve clinical practice; d. improve patient outcomes.  METHODS  The methods for this review were developed and refined in a series of workshops with input from an expert BEME systematic reviewer, and followed BEME guidance. Databases searched included Medline, CINAHL, BNI, Embase, EBM Collection, Psychlit, HMIC, ERIC, BEI, TIMElit and RDRB. Papers addressing self-assessment in all professions in clinical practice were included, covering under- and post-graduate education, with outcomes classified using an extended version of Kirkpatrick's hierarchy. In addition we included outcome measures of accuracy of self-assessment and factors influencing it. 5,798 papers were retrieved, 194 abstracts were identified as potentially relevant and 103 papers coded independently by pairs using an electronic coding sheet adapted from the standard BEME form. This total included 12 papers identified by hand-searches, grey literature, cited references and updating. The identification of a further 12 papers during the writing-up process resulted in a total of 77 papers for final analysis.  RESULTS  Although a large number of papers resulted from our original search only a small proportion of these were of sufficient academic rigour to be included in our review. The majority of these focused on judging the accuracy of self-assessment against some external standard, which raises questions about assumed reliability and validity of this 'gold standard'. No papers were found which satisfied Kirkpatrick's hierarchy above level 2, or which looked at the association between self-assessment and resulting changes in either clinical practice or patient outcomes. Thus our review was largely unable to answer the specific research questions and provide a solid evidence base for effective self-assessment. Despite this, there was some evidence that the accuracy of self-assessment can be enhanced by feedback, particularly video and verbal, and by providing explicit assessment criteria and benchmarking guidance. There was also some evidence that the least competent are also the least able to self-assess accurately. Our review recommends that these areas merit future systematic research to further our understanding of self-assessment.  CONCLUSION  As in other BEME reviews, the methodological issues emerging from this review indicate a need for more rigorous study designs. In addition, it highlights the need to consider the potential for combining qualitative and quantitative data to further our understanding of how self-assessment can improve learning and professional clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Asynchronous Learning Networks (ALN) are a form of "e-learning" that emphasizes the use of the Internet to support class discussions and activities. This paper presents a qualitative study of role changes that occur when faculty become online or "virtual" professors. In 20 semi-structured interviews of faculty, coded with pattern analysis software, the authors captured role changes enacted by instructors in ALN settings--cognitive roles, affective roles, and managerial roles. The cognitive role, which relates to mental processes of learning, information storage, and thinking, shifts to one of deeper cognitive complexity. The affective role, which relates to influencing the relationships between students, the instructor, and the classroom atmosphere, required faculty to find new tools to express emotion, yet they found the relationships with students more intimate. The managerial role, which deals with class and course management, requires grater attention to detail, more structure, and additional student monitoring. Overall, faculty reported a change in their teaching persona, toward more precision in their presentation of materials and instruction, combined with a shift to a more Socratic pedagogy, emphasizing multilogues with students. The main sources of frustration and of fulfillment of the virtual professor is explored.

Starting with qualitative responses to defensive and approach scenarios modeled on typical rodent ethoexperimental situations, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) revealed a robust 6-factor structure: 2 unitary defensive factors, fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS; related to fear) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; related to anxiety); and 4 behavioral approach system (BAS) factors (Reward Interest, Goal-Drive Persistence, Reward Reactivity, and Impulsivity). Theoretically motivated thematic facets were employed to sample the breadth of defensive space, comprising FFFS (Flight, Freeze, and Active Avoidance) and BIS (Motor Planning Interruption, Worry, Obsessive Thoughts, and Behavioral Disengagement). Based on theoretical considerations, and statistically confirmed, a separate scale for Defensive Fight was developed. Validation evidence for the 6-factor structure came from convergent and discriminant validity shown by correlations with existing personality scales. We offer the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality Questionnaire to facilitate future research specifically on rRST and, more broadly, on approach-avoidance theories of personality.

  abstract = {The term lurker connotes a low-value role in online communities. Despite making up the majority of members, these invisible individuals are often cast as peripheral players who should be encouraged to participate more fully. We argue that the lurker concept is problematic and that online communities, and the roles associated with them, need to be reconceptualized. We report on a study of online communities in a New Zealand professional development program. We found that two knowledge broker types played key roles in transferring knowledge: connector-leaders, who had a strong online presence, and follower-feeders, who communicated largely invisibly, via side-channels. Despite their different online profiles, both brokers used "lurking" purposively to perform two sets of invisible online activities: managing the knowledge agenda, and mentoring/being mentored. These activities supported their roles as leaders and followers, and sustained a symbiotic relationship. Decisions to "lurk" arose from the need for these brokers to negotiate diverse boundaries: the boundaries of micro-culture associated with communication contexts, the theory-practice boundary, role boundaries, and the online-offline boundary. Combining the concept of polycontextuality with boundary spanning theory, we propose an alternative way of understanding both lurking and online communities: the three-tier knowledge transfer ecosystem (KTE), a system of engagement spaces comprising diverse online and offline contexts in which individuals make continual decisions to cross between less- or more-visible settings. The study illustrates how key phenomena may remain invisible without a shift in level of analysis, and how using an anachronistic concept to frame a study can unintentionally constrain its value.},

In the first semester, during their writing class, students either received training in how to implement peer feedback or simply studied models of writing (that were also used in the training work). In the second semester, students either received teacher or peer feedback across multiple assignments. Writing competence, writing self-efficacy, and writing self-regulated learning were assessed at the beginning and end of the second semester. Trained peer feedback and teacher feedback had similar positive effects on the improvement of writing competence and writing self-efficacy. However, trained peer feedback led to a significant enhancement of students' autonomous motivation relative to no such growth from teacher feedback.},

  abstract = {This research addresses the tensions that arise between the collection and use of personal information that people provide in the course of most consumer transactions, and privacy. In today's electronic world, the competitive strategies of successful firms increasingly depend on vast amounts of customer data. Ironically, the same information practices that provide value to organizations also raise privacy concerns for individuals. This study hypothesized that organizations can address these privacy concerns and gain business advantage through customer retention by observing procedural fairness: customers will be willing to disclose personal information and have that information subsequently used to create consumer profiles for business use when there are fair procedures in place to protect individual privacy. Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior. Our hypothesis was supported as we found that when customers are explicitly told that fair information practices are employed, privacy concerns do not distinguish consumers who are willing to be profiled from those who are unwilling to have their personal information used in this way.},

These model types are not meant to be examples of specific executives a company might hire, but rather to serve as an indication of the CDO's potential range of roles and responsibilities.},

The purpose of this paper is to survey the existing research of effective design models for online learning in an attempt to identify best practices and present a new model. Design/methodology/approach: Through a comprehensive review of the literature, the paper identifies obstacles to developing an effective course design model for asynchronous distance education. Based upon this review, best practices are identified and a design model is recommended. Findings: The research identifies the key components of successful course design methods and ultimately recommends a process that has eight steps which occur in three phases. The first phase, the identification phase, encourages the instructor and/or course design team to identify strategies, objectives, assessments and resources. In the second phase, design, instructors select, organize, adapt and reflect. The final phase is implementation, during which the course is taught. Practical implications: The recommended design model has implications for practice by providing a clear structure for design activities which are aligned with the best practices identified in the research. Instructors and/or instructional designers creating online learning opportunities now have a coherent model supported by a review of the literature. Originality/value: While a number of online course design models exist, no one model has emerged as pre-eminent or most effective and efficient. The model recommended by this paper offers a unified model of courses design that synthesizes the most effective aspects of the extant models. (Contains 1 figure.)},

Appended are papers entitled: Assessment of Student Teachers, Assessment of Final Teaching Practice, Why Do I Wish to Teach?, and Biology Method. The second case study illustrates the planning and design of a course for teachers of general medical practice. An analysis of the course objectives, activities, and assessment is provided.

  abstract = {A common lament among quality professionals is that as soon as the leader who committed an organization to quality leaves, so does the focus on continual improvement. For example, under CEO Jamie Houghton, quality was king at Corning from 1983 to 1996, and the company won a Baldrige Award in 1995. The bottom fell out of the telecommunications sector, and Corning struggled both in the marketplace and stock market. The opposite is certainly true in the case of Richland College in Dallas, the first community college to receive the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. While the president's and founders' many years of service have been important, Richland's entire senior leadership team (called the ThunderTeam) and philosophy of empowering employees have played a key role in Richland's Baldrige award. The college has decreased its cost to budget while improving services, adding employees and implementing innovative approaches.},

As a result, a lot of time is spent searching for the most appropriate machine learning algorithms applicable in clinical prognosis that contains either binary-valued or multi-valued attributes. The study set out to identify and evaluate the performance of machine learning classification schemes applied in clinical prognosis of post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients. Multilayer Perceptron, J48, and the Naive Bayes algorithms were used to train and test models on Thoracic Surgery datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. Stratified 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate baseline performance accuracy of the classifiers. The comparative analysis shows that multilayer perceptron performed best with classification accuracy of 82.3\%, J48 came out second with classification accuracy of 81.8\%, and Naive Bayes came out the worst with classification accuracy of 74.4\%. The quality and outcome of the chosen machine learning algorithms depends on the ingenuity of the clinical miner.},

However, the dependent variable in these studies---I/S success ---has been an elusive one to define. Different researchers have addressed different aspects of success, making comparisons difficult and the prospect of building a cumulative tradition for I/S research similarly elusive. To organize this diverse research, as well as to present a more integrated view of the concept of I/S success, a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced. This taxonomy posits six major dimensions or categories of I/S success---SYSTEM QUALITY, INFORMATION QUALITY, USE, USER SATISFACTION, INDIVIDUAL IMPACT, and ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT. Using these dimensions, both conceptual and empirical studies are then reviewed (a total of 180 articles are cited) and organized according to the dimensions of the taxonomy. Finally, the many aspects of I/S success are drawn together into a descriptive model and its implications for future I/S research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Quantum Image Processing (QIP)is an exciting new field showing a lot of promise as a powerful addition to the arsenal of Image Processing techniques. Representing image pixel by pixel using classical information requires an enormous amount of computational resources. Hence, exploring methods to represent images in a different paradigm of information is important. In this work, we study the representation of images in Quantum Information. The main motivation for this pursuit is the ability of storing N bits of classical information in only log(2N) quantum bits (qubits). The promising first step was the exponentially efficient implementation of the Fourier transform in quantum computers as compared to Fast Fourier Transform in classical computers. In addition, images encoded in quantum information could obey unique quantum properties like superposition or entanglement.},

We discuss trends in eight substantive areas: (1) scale formats, (2) criteria for evaluating ratings, (3) training, (4) reactions to appraisal, (5) purpose of rating, (6) rating sources, (7) demographic differences in ratings, and (8) cognitive processes, and discuss what we have learned from research in each area. We also focus on trends during the heyday of performance appraisal research in JAP (1970-2000), noting which were more productive and which potentially hampered progress. Our overall conclusion is that JAP's role in this literature has not been to propose models and new ideas, but has been primarily to test ideas and models proposed elsewhere. Nonetheless, we conclude that the papers published in JAP made important contribution to the filed by addressing many of the critical questions raised by others. We also suggest several areas for future research, especially research focusing on performance management. (PsycINFO Database Record},

We investigate two aspects of feedback. Firstly, we investigate whether the conversational agent should employ a slant (or bias) in its feedback on particular test scores to motivate a learner with a particular personality trait more effectively (for example, using "you are slightly below expectations" versus "you are substantially below expectations" depending on learner conscientiousness). Secondly, we investigate which emotional support messages the conversational agent should use (for example: using praise, emotional reflection, reassurance or advice) given learner personality and performance. We investigate the adaptation of this feedback to a learner personality, in particular the traits in the Five Factor Model. Five experiments were run where participants gave progress feedback and emotional support to students with different personalities and test scores. The type of emotional support given varied between different personalities (e.g. neurotic individuals with poor grades received more emotional reflection). Two algorithms were created using different methods to describe the adaptations and evaluated on how well they described the experimental data using DICE scores. A refined algorithm was created based on the results. Finally, we ran a qualitative study with teachers to investigate the algorithm's effectiveness and further refine the algorithm.},

Results showed that emoticons are mostly used to express emotion, to strengthen a message, and to express humor. Furthermore, more emoticons were used in communication with friends than in communication with strangers, and more emoticons were used in a positive context than in a negative context. Participants seem to use emoticons in a way similar to facial behavior in face-to-face communication with respect to social context and interaction partner.},

Simple detection targets were preceded by cues labeling potential target locations as threatening (likely to result in negative feedback) or safe (likely to result in positive feedback). Trait anxious participants showed an early attentional bias favoring the threatening location 250 ms after the cue and a late bias favoring the safe location 500 ms after the cue. The anxiety-related threat bias was moderated by attentional control at the 500-ms delay: Anxious participants with poor attentional control still showed the threat bias, whereas those with good control were better able to shift from the threatening location. Thus, skilled control of voluntary attention may allow anxious persons to limit the impact of threatening information.},

  abstract = {We compared students' self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students' perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students' motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students' response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

The study found a variety of individualized learning practices are utilized by faculty and administrators at the course, program and institutional levels as strategies to meet students where they are in order to enable students to achieve their higher education goals. The study found that meeting students where they are was the core phenomenon of the theory and that meeting students where they are requires understanding the students current academic, financial and developmental status as well as their higher education goals.

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that information researchers should use images as a source of data. The information systems field is overwhelmingly visual in nature. Not only is the Internet crammed with images, but also almost every detail observed during fieldwork in different research settings can be captured in the form of digital images. Yet, we rarely engage with those images. Except for sporadic video recordings in analyzing human-computer interaction and, more recently, neurophysiological imaging, using images in information systems research has been sparse and non-systematic. Where images are used, the purpose of using them has been largely restricted to visually representing the context of the research setting. This approach underuses the knowledge embedded in visual material, which needs to be unpacked in a systematic fashion. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of visual research and illustrate via a three-step framework how images in information systems research can be collected, analyzed, and presented. We conclude with four considerations for researchers that can help them develop a visual research capacity in information systems and encourage researchers to engage with the images that are now a major feature of the information systems environment.},

Actual manifestations of such categories are domain-specific and within the domains phase-specific with regard to the value creation chain. The most important mean to reduce such risks are approaches that address the empowerment of employees. Knowledge about domain-specific risks of industry 4.0 is valuable for communication professionals that are engaged in intra-corporate change processes or risk communication.},

Yet, their complexity makes it difficult to explain and predict their functioning. We examined a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-3) using lexical decision tasks widely used to study the structure of semantic memory in humans. The results of four analyses showed that GPT-3's patterns of semantic activation are broadly similar to those observed in humans, showing significantly higher semantic activation in related (e.g., "lime-lemon") word pairs than in other-related (e.g., "sour-lemon") or unrelated (e.g., "tourist-lemon") word pairs. However, there are also significant differences between GPT-3 and humans. GPT-3's semantic activation is better predicted by similarity in words' meaning (i.e., semantic similarity) rather than their co-occurrence in the language (i.e., associative similarity). This suggests that GPT-3's semantic network is organized around word meaning rather than their co-occurrence in text.},

Individuals make choices in which they surrender a certain degree of privacy in exchange for outcomes that are perceived to be worth the risk of information disclosure. This research attempts to better understand the delicate balance between privacy risk beliefs and confidence and enticement beliefs that influence the intention to provide personal information necessary to conduct transactions on the Internet. A theoretical model that incorporated contrary factors representing elements of a privacy calculus was tested using data gathered from 369 respondents. Structural equations modeling (SEM) using LISREL validated the instrument and the proposed model. The results suggest that although Internet privacy concerns inhibit e-commerce transactions, the cumulative influence of Internet trust and personal Internet interest are important factors that can outweigh privacy risk perceptions in the decision to disclose personal information when an individual uses the Internet. These findings provide empirical support for an extended privacy calculus model.},

AIMS  To investigate the relationship between achievement motives, achievement goals, learning strategies (deep, surface, and strategic), and academic achievement in a hierarchical model.  SAMPLE  Participants were 229 undergraduate students (mean age: 21.2 years) of psychology and economics at the University of Bergen, Norway.  METHODS  Variables were measured by means of items from the Achievement Motives Scale (AMS), the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students, and an achievement goal scale.  RESULTS  Correlation analysis showed that academic achievement (examination grade) was positively correlated with performance-approach goal, mastery goal, and strategic learning strategies, and negatively correlated with performance-avoidance goal and surface learning strategy. A path analysis (structural equation model) showed that achievement goals were mediators between achievement motives and learning strategies, and that strategic learning strategies mediated the relationship between achievement goals and academic achievement.  CONCLUSIONS  This study integrated previous findings from several studies and provided new evidence on the direct and indirect effects of different types of motives and learning strategies as predictors of academic achievement.},

  abstract = {Online course design is an emerging practice in higher education, yet few theoretical models currently exist to explain or predict how the diffusion of innovations occurs in this space. This study used a descriptive, quantitative survey research design to examine theoretical relationships between decision-making style and resistance to change among higher education online course designers and the potential influence on the diffusion of innovations in online course design. The original theoretical model proposed in this study was partially supported. This study found that online course designers in higher education were diverse with regards to training and experience for designing online courses and that an online course designer's decision-making style does not likely contribute to their level of resistance to change. In addition, the majority of online course designers in this study were rational decision-makers, reported a generally low resistance to change, and responded to change situations with cognitive rigidity. Four "types" of online course designers were identified based on decision-making style, resistance to change, and response to change situations. These types were classified as: reactors, visionaries, traditionalists, and planners. The study concluded that the lengthier and more detailed decision-making processes of rational decision-makers and the rigidity of online course designers' willingness to change perspectives likely moderates the diffusion of innovations in higher education online course design. In addition, the types of online course designers identified in this study informed the development of a revised theoretical framework for explaining how the combination of these characteristics may influence how online course designers contribute to the diffusion of online course design innovations. The types of online course designers may also be used to develop customized tools and strategies for promoting innovative online course design practices.},

The first section contains a review of recent research in cognitive psychology on the intellectual demands of the tasks contained in the school curriculum, with particular attention to the inherent complexity of most of the tasks students encounter. The findings of this research are brought to bear on the issue of direct versus indirect instruction. The second section is directed to studies of how academic work is accomplished in classroom environments. Classrooms appear to shape the content of the curriculum in fundamental ways for all students and especially those who find academic work difficult. In addition, the processes that are likely to have the greatest long-term consequences are the most difficult to teach in classrooms. The paper concludes with an analysis of issues related to improving instruction and extending current directions in research on teaching.},

  abstract = {Online product reviews underpin nearly all e-shopping activities. The high volume of data, as well as various online review quality, puts growing pressure on automated approaches for informative content prioritization. Despite a substantial body of literature on review helpfulness prediction, the rationale behind specific feature selection is largely under-studied. Also, the current works tend to concentrate on domain- and/or platform-dependent feature curation, lacking wider generalization. Moreover, the issue of result comparability and reproducibility occurs due to frequent data and source code unavailability. This study addresses the gaps through the most comprehensive feature identification, evaluation, and selection. To this end, the 30 most frequently used content-based features are first identified from 149 relevant research papers and grouped into five coherent categories. The features are then selected to perform helpfulness prediction on six domains of the largest publicly available Amazon 5-core dataset. Three scenarios for feature selection are considered: (i) individual features, (ii) features within each category, and (iii) all features. Empirical results demonstrate that semantics plays a dominant role in predicting informative reviews, followed by sentiment, and other features. Finally, feature combination patterns and selection guidelines across domains are summarized to enhance customer experience in today's prevalent e-commerce environment. The computational framework for helpfulness prediction used in the study have been released to facilitate result comparability and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) uses artificial intelligence techniques to imitate in computer form the power of human tutorial processes. Its major technical features are the use of a modularized knowledge base instead of CAI's textual scripts, and the ability to interpret the student's statements and questions expressed in natural English. These features make ICAI systems extremely flexible and allow the student much greater learner control of the interaction than is traditionally possible in CAI. Other major elements of an ICAI system are an extensive model of the student and an explicit model of the tutoring process. Our research on the development of GEO, an ICAI system which interacts with students in the area of geography, is briefly described. Finally, the nature of this new technology is discussed in terms of its potential influence on university teaching and learning, especially in terms of our conception of learning.

In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 230 exercises - many with solutions - and numerous suggestions for further reading. This second edition includes extended and completely revised chapters on process identification, process discovery, qualitative process analysis, process redesign, process automation and process monitoring. A new chapter on BPM as an enterprise capability has been added, which expands the scope of the book to encompass topics such as the strategic alignment and governance of BPM initiatives. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website.},

The paper provides a description of the required technology tools and the class conduct. The students used a combination of asynchronous and synchronous learning methods that allowed them to complete the coursework on a self-determined schedule, subject to semi-weekly quiz constraints. The course material was presented in content pages with links to Excel problems, Flash examples, audio and video files, and self-tests. Students worked the quizzes and then met in their groups in a chat room to resolve differences in answers. Student surveys indicated satisfaction with the learning methods. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The participants of the study were 19 learners who took the programming languages course (via the DLP for 14 weeks). Before the application, the preparation of the DLP took nearly 500 hours. A pilot study was performed with the learners during the summer school. The design of the DLP was improved through the views of those learners. The data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with the learners. The following themes emerged from analysis of the data: factors in preferring the DLP, general characteristics of the DLP, the effectiveness of the DLP, and expansion of the DLP. These themes are further analyzed on the basis of "Diffusion of Innovations" and "Uses and Gratifications" theories. As a result of the interviews conducted with the learners, it was found that the learners had positive opinions about the DLP as it (1) offers flexibility, (2) contains elements enhancing their motivation, (3) enables the learners to communicate easily with the instructor, (4) provides the learners with instant feedback, and (5) enables them to access to the course materials easily.},

Through a self-reflection process, teachers can self-assess their digital competence, identifying strengths and weaknesses. Based on the tool feedback, they can plan their professional learning and further development of their digital competence.  SELFIEforTEACHERS aims to empower teachers to actively engage in their professional learning process and to support them in their use of digital technologies in their professional context. It is a learning journey rather than an assessment tool.  At the same time, it provides a tool for education systems to support teachers in their professional development. Aggregated results generated by self-reflections within a group, support planning of professional development programmes.  SELFIEforTEACHERS is available online for teachers across Europe and beyond. It is currently available in 29 languages, including all official languages of the European Union. It is an action of the European Commission Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.},

Learning goals, in which individuals seek to increase their competence, were predicted to promote challenge-seeking and a mastery-oriented response to failure regardless of perceived ability. Performance goals, in which individuals seek to gain favorable judgments of their competence or avoid negative judgments, were predicted to produce challenge-avoidance and learned helplessness when perceived ability was low and to promote certain forms of risk-avoidance even when perceived ability was high. Manipulations of relative goal value (learning vs. performance) and perceived ability (high vs. low) resulted in the predicted differences on measures of task choice, performance during difficulty, and spontaneous verbalizations during difficulty. Particularly striking was the way in which the performance goal-low perceived ability condition produced the same pattern of strategy deterioration, failure attribution, and negative affect found in naturally occurring learned helplessness. Implications for theories of motivation and achievement are discussed.},

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

Student involvement in peer assessment leads to significant improvement in students' performance, supports students' learning, promotes the development of evaluation skills and encourages reflection.  AIM  The aim of this study is to assess perceptions of the Formative Peer Assessment (FPA) initiative within a higher education setting for undergraduate radiography students.  METHODS  Qualitative action research was conducted. Students were allowed to anonymously assess each other's assignments using a standardized evaluation sheet that they had been trained to use. Participants' perceptions were assessed through focus group discussion.  RESULTS  The findings showed that students' experiences with peer assessment were positive. Students acknowledged that they received valuable feedback and learned from assessing their peers. Students recommended the need for training and suggested using more than one evaluator.  CONCLUSION  The FPA initiative in the study institution believed to be succeed as the students had a positive experience with the FPA. Students learnt from PA and from self-assessment. Implementation of PA will promote reflection and critical thinking and problem solving skills, that are important traits in radiography graduate profile as in radiography clinical practice the professional require to modify imaging techniques and critique images to ensure the quality of care.},

The Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI) was constructed to measure the 2 independent processing modes with a modified Need for Cognition Scale (NFC, J.T. Cacioppo \& R.E. Petty, 1982) and a new scale, Faith in Intuition (FI). In Study 1, a factor analysis yielded 2 orthogonal factors corresponding to NFC and FI. Although heuristic processing was determined primarily by FI, NFC also contributed to heuristic responding, in line with CEST. The relation of FI and NFC to coping ability also was examined. In Study 2, the factor structure of the REI was replicated (N = 973). NFC and FI were differentially related to measures of personality, adjustment, achievement, and interpersonal relations.},

The book reviews innovative methods for measuring experts' knowledge and performance in relevant tasks. Sixteen major domains of expertise are covered, including sports, music, medicine, business, writing, and drawing, with leading researchers summarizing their knowledge about the structure and acquisition of expert skills and knowledge, and discussing future prospects. General issues that cut across most domains are reviewed in chapters on various aspects of expertise, such as general and practical intelligence, differences in brain activity, self-regulated learning, deliberate practice, aging, knowledge management, and creativity},

Recent studies have shown that fronto-central event-related potentials (ERPs) are sensitive to feedback valence and can be used as an index of feedback processing. The present study investigated whether the processes involved in feedback evaluation are affected by top-down mechanisms driven by knowledge about feedback validity. In a simple decision task, participants had to make use of feedback to learn which one of two stimuli was associated with a reward in a later test phase. Feedback stimuli were followed by a cue indicating whether feedback was valid or invalid. Prior to each block, participants were informed about the frequency of valid feedback in this block. An effect of feedback validity was obtained not only for learning but also for fronto-central ERPs. While high-validity feedback was associated with a fronto-central valence effect, this effect was absent for low-validity feedback. This indicates that processes involved in feedback evaluation are affected by prior knowledge about feedback validity via top-down processes.},

For feedback processing, this can be beneficial as well as detrimental: If novelty lends a rewarding characteristic to a stimulus, then this should particularly decrease the impact of negative feedback. The present study investigated whether such an effect of feedback novelty on feedback processing is reflected in electrophysiological markers of reinforcement learning (feedback-related negativity, FRN) and feedback processing (feedback-P300) in a simple decision-making task. In this task, participants had to chose between two stimuli in a learning trial followed by a novel or a familiar feedback stimulus. Learning from feedback allowed them to optimize their payoff in a later test trial. As expected, we found that the FRN effect, i.e. the difference between the FRN amplitudes after negative and positive feedback, was reduced for novel compared to familiar feedback stimuli. In addition, the amplitude of the feedback-P300 was decreased by feedback novelty, both for the anterior P3a and the posterior P3b. Together, these results indicate that feedback novelty can affect feedback processing as reflected by feedback-related brain activity.},

  abstract = {Computer-mediated communication has become a major research topic due to the growing number of graduate-level students entirely or partially enrolled in Internet-based degree programs. Drawing on the concept of common ground from Clark's communication theory, we propose a model to investigate the varying quality and flow of online learning conversations. Our investigation centers on three discourse systems in order to isolate the effects of two functional differences: online presence of the learning material and a linking functionality. The first system, which supports parallel artifact-centered discourse, displays the learning material and its related discussion in a single window. The second system, which supports linked artifact-centered discourse, provides a bi-directional linking functionality between these two elements available in a single window. The control system, which supports conventional discourse, offers the two elements in separate windows. We conducted an experiment with 30 doctoral students enrolled in three sections of an introductory research methods seminar. A total of 30 discussion transcripts, 10 for each group, formed the basis of the data analyses. Using an integrated approach that combined content and sequential analyses, we categorized and sequentially plotted all messages. The findings demonstrate that the online presence of the learning material supports sustained discussions centered on understanding the meaning of a text. Moreover, a linking functionality promotes complex forms of interaction with the learning material and re-focuses the discussion when it digresses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We evaluate our approach against a number of baselines and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness on both the AES task and the task of flagging adversarial input, further contributing to the development of an approach that strengthens the validity of neural essay scoring models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have become the method of choice for researchers working on algorithmic aspects of recommender systems. With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

  abstract = {AIM  Although studies have examined medical students' ability to self-assess their performance, there are few longitudinal studies that document the stability of self-assessment accuracy over time. This study compares actual and estimated examination performance for three classes during their first 3 years of medical school.  METHODS  Students assessed their performance on classroom examinations and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) stations. Each self-assessment was then contrasted with their actual performance using idiographic (within-subject) methods to define three measures of self-assessment accuracy: bias (arithmetic differences of actual and estimated scores), deviation (absolute differences of actual and estimated scores), and covariation (correlation of actual and estimated scores). These measures were computed for four intervals over the course of 3 years. Multivariate analyses of variance and correlational analyses were used to evaluate the stability of these measures.  RESULTS  Self-assessment accuracy measures were relatively stable over the first 2 years of medical school with a decease occurring in the third year. However, the correlational analyses indicated that the stability of self-assessment accuracy was comparable to the stability of actual performance over this same period.  CONCLUSION  The apparent decline in accuracy in the third year may reflect the transition from familiar classroom-based examinations to the substantially different clinical examination tasks of the third year OSCE. However, the stability of self-assessment accuracy compares favorably with the stability of actual performance over this period. These results suggest that self-assessment accuracy is a relatively stable individual characteristic that may be influenced by task familiarity.},

The IEA uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is both a computational model of human knowledge representation and a method for extracting semantic similarity of words and passages from text. Simulations of psycholinguistic phenomena show that LSA reflects similarities of human meaning effectively. To assess essay quality, LSA is first trained on domain-representative text. Then student essays are characterized by LSA representations of the meaning of their contained words and compared with essays of known quality on degree of conceptual relevance and amount of relevant content. Over many diverse topics, the IEA scores agreed with human experts as accurately as expert scores agreed with each other. Implications are discussed for incorporating automatic essay scoring in more general forms of educational technology.},

Competing perspectives and caveats on this view have suggested that negative feedback may sometimes have neutral or even positive effects. This meta-analysis of 78 studies examined the effect of negative feedback on intrinsic motivation in both child and adult samples. Results indicated that negative feedback had no effect on intrinsic motivation when compared to neutral or no feedback. When compared to positive feedback, negative feedback decreased intrinsic motivation. Moderator tests revealed that the effect of negative feedback seemed to be less demotivating when (a) the feedback statement included instructional details on how to improve, (b) criterion-based standards were used to provide feedback, and (c) feedback was delivered in-person. Implications for future research and applications to real-world settings are discussed.},

However, a significant shortcoming of e-learning technologies has been poor support for group-oriented learning. We believe that virtual worlds offer a potential solution. Unlike videoconferencing (for instance), virtual worlds provide a shared visual space for students to meet and interact (via avatars). Not only do students share the quasi-realism of a 3D environment where participants can see and hear one another, they also have the capability to manipulate artifacts together. These factors provide a strong sense of group presence, which leads to engaging group learning interactions.

"Explorations in Science and Mathematics" was designed to develop core skills, critical thinking and communication, understanding of math and science as real-life activities, confidence in the subject matter, and metacognitive awareness of the learning processes involved. During the pilot semester, a constant comparison method was used to identify topics studied, engagement, beliefs and attitudes about mathematics and science throughout the course, comprehension of course content, and connections drawn to future teaching. Primary sources of data were interviews with faculty, notes and records from the course planning process, course documents, comprehensive portfolios of all student course work, and focus group interviews with students conducted at the end of the semester. Categories of Silence (knowing in action), Received Knowing, Subjective Knowing, Procedural Knowing, and Constructed Knowing from "Women's Ways of Knowing" became important in the construction of rubrics. Students who did well tended toward Procedural (connected) and Subjective ways of knowing. Discrepancies between faculty and student expectations indicate that pre-existing negative student attitudes are more resistant to change than the literature on teaching reform initiatives indicates.

  abstract = {This paper reports on the development and extension of a concept mapping tool into a complete online course design support framework for academics: CEDOT (Course Elicitation, Development and Output Tool). The tool provides a course design framework that faculty work through in an order of their choosing. It gives context specific help and advice that will enable them to complete all the required elements. As well as taking them through the course design process and creating a document that adheres to a university-defined format, at its core is a concept mapping and navigation tool to plan and structure the relationship between the various course elements, processes and resources. The course design framework outlined in this paper applies to Web based courses and to courses designed to be delivered "conventionally" through face-to-face teaching or through mixed modes of delivery. A key feature of CEDOT is that at any time during the course development process the thinking and work carried out so far can be made available via the Web to other academics associated with the course. They can comment on the course structure so far developed and their input can be incorporated into revised versions. CEDOT will output documentation associated with the course in various formats, exploiting the potential of XML according to the needs of identified groups. This includes information for course administrators and validation/approval committees and information for the student handbook and course guides. The tool is more than a documentation framework; it also enables the publishing of the course resources onto the Web implementing the navigational structure as developed in the concept map element of the tool. This Web structure may be in outline form, i.e. a navigational structure is in place with descriptors of the course content for further development or if appropriate, a fully functioning and complete version of the course resources may be output. Another key feature of CEDOT is its use of XML so that outputs can be customized according to the needs of different groups. CEDOT will also conform to emerging standards for learning architectures.

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes--although the greatest effects are in small (n {$\leq$} 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

From these considerations, it is reasoned that the complex paradigm offers a foundation to conceive a unique design concept. The complex educational design is then described in its constructs and features. To conclude, reflections and implications of this original, conceptual model are taken into account. Findings: An online language course design-although aiming at schematizing a series of learning situations and defining target teaching contents-needs to contemplate unpredictability and instability which prevent it from having a pre-established fixed design.

Based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis, we provide an overview of global perceptions and reactions to ChatGPT regarding education. ChatGPT triggered a massive response on Twitter, with education being the most tweeted content topic. Topics ranged from specific (e.g., cheating) to broad (e.g., opportunities), which were discussed with mixed sentiment. We traced that authority decisions may influence public opinions. We discussed that the average reaction on Twitter (e.g., using ChatGPT to cheat in exams) differs from discussions in which education and teaching-learning researchers are likely to be more interested (e.g., ChatGPT as an intelligent learning partner). This study provides insights into people's reactions when new groundbreaking technology is released and implications for scientific and policy communication in rapidly changing circumstances.},

As a team of learners across the educational hierarchy, we apply scholarly tools to the teaching process and learning outcomes of student-centered inquiries in a food systems course. The course, an interdisciplinary, lower division undergraduate course at the University of California, Davis is part of a new undergraduate major in Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems. We provide an overview of the course's core elements-labs, exams, assignments, and lectures-as they relate to social constructivist learning theory and student-centered inquiries. Then, through qualitative analysis of students' reflective essays about their learning experiences in the course, we demonstrate important transformative outcomes of student-centered inquiries: (1) most students confronted the commodity fetish and tried to reconcile tensions between what the food system is and ought to be, and (2) students repositioned themselves, their thinking, and social deliberation in relation to the food system. Students' reflections point to the power of learning that emerges through their inquiry process, including in the field, and from critical self-reflection. We also highlight the importance of reflective essays in both reinforcing experiential learning and in helping instructors to better understand students' learning vis--vis our teaching.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {To achieve faithful reasoning that aligns with human expectations, large language models (LLMs) need to ground their reasoning to real-world knowledge (e.g., web facts, math and physical rules). Tools help LLMs access this external knowledge, but there remains challenges for fine-tuning LLM agents (e.g., Toolformer) to invoke tools in multi-step reasoning problems, where inter-connected tool calls require holistic and efficient tool usage planning.  In this work, we propose a new method for LLMs to better leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. Our method, Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA), trains LLMs to first decode reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, and then call domain tools to reify each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge. This planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more general reasoning strategies, which are robust to shifts of domain knowledge (e.g., math results) relevant to different reasoning questions. It also allows LLMs to perform decoding and calling of external tools in parallel, which avoids the inference delay caused by waiting for tool responses. In mathematical reasoning and Wiki QA domains, we show that our method consistently outperforms previous chain-of-thought and tool-augmented baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, with an average {\textasciitilde}6\% absolute QA accuracy improvement. LLM agents trained with our method also show more efficient tool use, with inference speed being on average {\textasciitilde}1.4x faster than baseline tool-augmented LLMs.},

Design/methodology/approach: An action research-based course evaluation methodology was linked to course design and development at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Involving students via effective communication provided a sense of connection and greater understanding for instructors in terms of engagement through direct insight into relevant issues of student learning and knowledge management. Findings: The use of this and a wide variety of other relevant information via the application of action research provided an innovative platform that embedded the desire to innovate and improve the learning outcomes by combining course evaluation with a continuous course design process. This has been shown to be a far more effective method than the narrow measurement process of student course evaluation questionnaires. Research limitations/implications: As with all action research this is a continually evolving process and the data provided are from early iterations of the cycle. Practical implications: The research provides a platform for ongoing investigation of learning while improving and assuring outcomes for those involved in the process. Originality/value: The study presents a new paradigm in action via a case study set within core management and human resource management courses. The new evaluation methodology, together with its implementation, has proved beneficial in terms of innovation through the action research cycle.},

  abstract = {Social comparison theories typically imply a comparable degree of competition between commensurate rivals who are competing on a mutually important dimension. However, the present analysis reveals that the degree of competition between such rivals depends on their proximity to a meaningful standard. Studies 1 to 3 test the prediction that individuals become more competitive and less willing to maximize profitable joint gains when they and their commensurate rivals are highly ranked (e.g., \#2 vs. \#3) than when they are not (e.g., \#202 vs. \#203). Studies 4 to 6 then generalize these findings, showing that the degree of competition also increases in the proximity of other meaningful standards, such as the bottom of a ranking scale or a qualitative threshold in the middle of a scale. Studies 7 and 8 further examine the psychological processes underlying this phenomenon and reveal that proximity to a standard exerts a direct impact on the basic unidirectional drive upward, beyond the established effects of commensurability and dimension relevance.},

  abstract = {This paper describes AllenNLP, a platform for research on deep learning methods in natural language understanding. AllenNLP is designed to support researchers who want to build novel language understanding models quickly and easily. It is built on top of PyTorch, allowing for dynamic computation graphs, and provides (1) a flexible data API that handles intelligent batching and padding, (2) high-level abstractions for common operations in working with text, and (3) a modular and extensible experiment framework that makes doing good science easy. It also includes reference implementations of high quality approaches for both core semantic problems (e.g. semantic role labeling (Palmer et al., 2005)) and language understanding applications (e.g. machine comprehension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)). AllenNLP is an ongoing open-source effort maintained by engineers and researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract = {A separate and distinct interaction with both the actual e-vendor and with its IT Web site interface is at the heart of online shopping. Previous research has established, accordingly, that online purchase intentions are the product of both consumer assessments of the IT itself-specifically its perceived usefulness and ease-of-use (TAM)-and trust in the e-vendor. But these perspectives have been examined independently by IS researchers. Integrating these two perspectives and examining the factors that build online trust in an environment that lacks the typical human interaction that often leads to trust in other circumstances advances our understanding of these constructs and their linkages to behavior. Our research on experienced repeat online shoppers shows that consumer trust is as important to online commerce as the widely accepted TAM use-antecedents, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Together these variable sets explain a considerable proportion of variance in intended behavior. The study also provides evidence that online trust is built through (1) a belief that the vendor has nothing to gain by cheating, (2) a belief that there are safety mechanisms built into the Web site, and (3) by having a typical interface, (4) one that is, moreover, easy to use.},

We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.

Our use of gated linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of Wu et al. (2016) on both WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French translation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.},

Calibration is training to help a reviewer match the scores given by the instructor. Reputation systems determine how well each reviewer's scores track scores assigned by other reviewers. Meta-reviewing means evaluating the quality of a review; this can be done either by a human or by software. Combining these strategies effectively is a topic for future research.},

We present an architecture that exponentially reduces the requirements for a memory call: O(logN) switches need be thrown instead of the N used in conventional (classical or quantum) RAM designs. This yields a more robust QRAM algorithm, as it in general requires entanglement among exponentially less gates, and leads to an exponential decrease in the power needed for addressing.

In conversation, coaches can intervene to promote learning goal attainment by using behavioural change techniques (BCTs). In a coaching chatbot, such techniques can be ordered in an established, structured way to good effect. With recent technological advances, chatbot responses can be generated adaptively; this means that BCTs can be applied in an adaptive but less structured way. It is yet unclear whether this latter form of configuring coaching interventions is viable, how they compare to more established structured interventions, and whether both methods can be combined. For the purpose of answering this, we propose a 2x2 experimental design with the two intervention types as factors and goal attainment as the dependent variable. Results will indicate avenues for automating skilled conversation including choice of technology.},

This study examines literature on humanitarian logistics and service-learning and evaluates the integration of concepts. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory case study approach was used to understand the integration of service-learning and humanitarian logistics. This was achieved by exploring current literature, piloting courses, providing relief, and documenting factors that facilitate successful service-learning experiences. Findings - Findings from this information-oriented work demonstrate the applicability of service-learning methods in humanitarian logistics education and contributes to current research by addressing urgent global needs. Practical implications - This case has practical relevance for logistics educators, humanitarian agencies, and service-learning leaders as it outlines various challenges and steps to developing a humanitarian logistics course with potential pathways for research. By integrating the theories and principles of service-learning with major logistics and supply-chain management concepts, colleges, and universities in collaboration with relief agencies can facilitate an impactful humanitarian logistics learning experience that provides needed support to disaster response. Originality/value - There is a scarcity of literature that connects humanitarian logistics and service-learning. This case shows that the service-learning movement shares a common purpose with many humanitarian organizations that work to foster citizenship, education, and community well-being. This paper is a first of its kind to study the efforts necessary to create a successful humanitarian logistics course that benefits students, faculty, communities, and institutions through applying service-learning principles.},

Focus of this paper will be set on the infrastructure for the automatic acquisition of large amounts of monolingual text in many languages from various sources.

The mainly language-independent framework for preprocessing, cleaning and creating the corpora and computing the necessary statistics will also be depicted.}

We find that tool-enabled conversational agents often become sidetracked, as additional context from tools like search engines or calculators diverts from original user intents. To address this, we explore a concept wherein the user becomes the tool, providing necessary details and refining their requests. Through Conversation Analysis, we characterize this interaction as insert-expansion - an intermediary conversation designed to facilitate the preferred response. We explore possibilities arising from this 'user-as-a-tool' approach in two empirical studies using direct comparison, and find benefits in the recommendation domain.},

Agents often employ tools beyond language generation, such as calculators or search, to further augment these capabilities. We focus on how such tools can give the agent too much external context, diverting it from the user's original intent. According to Conversation Analysis, human-human dialogue often uses "insert-expansion" - inserted utterances for clarification - to resolve ambiguities. Building on this, we introduce a "user-as-a-tool" approach, enabling the AI agent to solicit clarification from the user while still reasoning, thereby realigning it with the user's intent. Initial evidence shows that our approach has benefits for conversational recommendation systems. We present a novel interaction method and empirical findings that enhance the user's role in guiding agent reasoning. This research is especially relevant as AI agents become increasingly common, and holds significance for optimizing the human-chatbot interaction loop.},

Recent innovations have uncovered that multiple chained calls tend to produce better results. Even more impactful is the discovery that these chains do not need to be predefined. LLM-based AI agents use frameworks to generate written intermediate reasoning that decides which steps to take next and when to return with a final output. LLM-based AI agents can use external tools like search engines, calculators, code engines, etc. to gather information and act on the world. Developments in this area are rapid and potentially consequential. However, it is difficult to keep apace with the developments. To address this, we introduce a typology grounded in recent research that provides a structured framework for understanding LLM-based agents, facilitating proactive engagement with future developments.},

The basic research questions are: how do features of CAS enhance organizational learning, and how does organizational context influence the role of CAS in organizational learning? The theoretical framework focuses on the decision to contribute and adopt knowledge in distributed environments. Specifically, the paper investigates the intersections between the features of CAS and inhibitors to contributing or adopting knowledge, in the light of different organizational context variables. Two cases of information environments for knowledge sharing are examined: a formal electronic library system and an informal community that uses a variety of communication technologies. The cases are used to illustrate how the intersection between CAS features and the decisions to adopt and contribute enhance or inhibit knowledge sharing.

More specific feedback was beneficial for learning how to respond to good performance and detrimental for learning how to respond to poor performance.

  abstract = {Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been impressive. However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior, such as hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive and toxic content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially "black boxes" to validate and progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance of external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs.},

This may limit more meaningful educational approaches towards workplace-based assessment (WBA). Cognition-based models of WBA argue that assessment outcomes are determined by cognitive processes by raters which are very similar to reasoning, judgment and decision making in professional domains such as medicine. The present study explores cognitive processes that underlie judgment and decision making by raters when observing performance in the clinical workplace. It specifically focuses on how differences in rating experience influence information processing by raters. Verbal protocol analysis was used to investigate how experienced and non-experienced raters select and use observational data to arrive at judgments and decisions about trainees' performance in the clinical workplace. Differences between experienced and non-experienced raters were assessed with respect to time spent on information analysis and representation of trainee performance; performance scores; and information processing--using qualitative-based quantitative analysis of verbal data. Results showed expert-novice differences in time needed for representation of trainee performance, depending on complexity of the rating task. Experts paid more attention to situation-specific cues in the assessment context and they generated (significantly) more interpretations and fewer literal descriptions of observed behaviors. There were no significant differences in rating scores. Overall, our findings seemed to be consistent with other findings on expertise research, supporting theories underlying cognition-based models of assessment in the clinical workplace. Implications for WBA are discussed.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and kisspeptin-1 (KISS-1) regulate placental development and fetal growth. The predictive value of maternal serum BDNF and KISS-1 concentrations for placental and umbilical cord levels has not yet been explored. The influence of prenatal lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) exposure and maternal iron status on BDNF and KISS-1 levels is also unclarified and of concern. In a pilot cross-sectional study with 65 mother-newborn pairs, we analyzed maternal and cord serum levels of pro-BDNF, mature BDNF, and KISS-1, BDNF, and KISS-1 gene expression in placenta, Pb and Cd in maternal and umbilical cord blood (erythrocytes), and placenta. We conducted a series of in vitro experiments using human primary trophoblast cells (hTCs) and BeWo cells to verify main findings of the epidemiological analysis. Strong and consistent correlations were observed between maternal serum levels of pro-BDNF, mature BDNF, and KISS-1 and corresponding levels in umbilical serum and placental tissue. Maternal red blood cell Pb levels were inversely correlated with serum and placental KISS-1 levels. Lower expression and release of KISS-1 was also observed in Pb-exposed BeWo cells. In vitro Pb exposure also reduced cellular BDNF levels. Cd-treated BeWo cells showed increased pro-BDNF levels. Low maternal iron status was positively associated with low BDNF levels. Iron-deficient hTCs and BeWo cells showed a consistent decrease in the release of mature BDNF. The correlations between maternal BDNF and KISS-1 levels, placental gene expression, and umbilical cord serum levels, respectively, indicate the strong potential of maternal serum as predictive matrix for BDNF and KISS-1 levels in placentas and fetal sera. Pb exposure and iron status modulate BDNF and KISS-1 levels, but a clear direction of modulations was not evident. The associations need to be confirmed in a larger sample and validated in terms of placental and neurodevelopmental function.

Governments and institutions use a variety of approaches to measuring qualityinternal and external committee reviews, formal assessments using standards and benchmarks created by government or professional bodies, and reviews of inputs and outputs akin to the quality assurance approaches of business and industry.

The search is described from course inception in 1997 through to 2000, three successive years of trial and change in course implementation. The historical overview lays the theoretical foundation, discusses the practical realities, and provides a rationale for the decision-making steps in the design and application of a CALL writing course model. The designers, who are also the instructors, attempt to apply theoretical and research-based tenets for computer-mediated L2 writing courses to their design model. These tenets are catalogued under three general headings: stakeholders, technological considerations, and writing outcomes. In their attempts to apply theoretical recommendations, the designers found that such theory often collides with practical constraints. The constraints, sometimes of a sociocultural nature and sometimes of a methodological nature, are described and discussed. The course design model which emerges to a certain degree compromises theory and research in order to accommodate practice, but, as the article concludes, it is workable and it works.

Drawing on the literature of teaching and learning in sociology and higher education more broadly, "First Contact" provides an overview of the scholarship of teaching and learning, best practices, and other essential information to create a successful first course in sociology. It walks the instructor through the course design process-from learning about whom your students are, determining appropriate course goals and learning objectives, and using these ideas to design, execute, and assess your course. It examines the core content of a first course. It discusses how to design a syllabus, select textbooks and readings, as well as how to design and deliver effective lectures, facilitate good discussions, and other course delivery options.

  abstract = {Design work and design knowledge in Information Systems (IS) is important for both research and practice. Yet there has been comparatively little critical attention paid to the problem of specifying design theory so that it can be communicated, justified, and developed cumulatively. In this essay we focus on the structural components or anatomy of design theories in IS as a special class of theory. In doing so, we aim to extend the work of Walls, Widemeyer and El Sawy (1992) on the specification of information systems design theories (ISDT), drawing on other streams of thought on design research and theory to provide a basis for a more systematic and useable formulation of these theories. We identify eight separate components of design theories: (1) purpose and scope, (2) constructs, (3) principles of form and function, (4) artifact mutability, (5) testable propositions, (6) justificatory knowledge (kernel theories), (7) principles of implementation, and (8) an expository instantiation. This specification includes components missing in the Walls et al. adaptation of Dubin (1978) and Simon (1969) and also addresses explicitly problems associated with the role of instantiations and the specification of design theories for methodologies and interventions as well as for products and applications. The essay is significant as the unambiguous establishment of design knowledge as theory gives a sounder base for arguments for the rigor and legitimacy of IS as an applied discipline and for its continuing progress. A craft can proceed with the copying of one example of a design artifact by one artisan after another. A discipline cannot. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {This essay derives a schema for specifying design principles for information technology-based artifacts in sociotechnical systems. Design principles are used to specify design knowledge in an accessible form, but there is wide variation and lack of precision across views on their formulation. This variation is a sign of important issues that should be addressed, including a lack of attention to human actors and levels of complexity as well as differing views on causality, on the nature of the mechanisms used to achieve goals, and on the need for justificatory knowledge. The new schema includes the well-recognized elements of design principles, including goals in a specific context and the mechanisms to achieve the goal. In addition, the schema allows: (i) consideration of the varying roles of the human actors involved and the utility of design principles; (ii) attending to the complexity of IT-based artifacts through decomposition;(iii) distinction of the types of causation (i.e., deterministic versus probabilistic); (iv) a variety of mechanisms in achieving aims; and (v) the optional definition of justificatory knowledge underlying the design principles. We illustrate the utility of the proposed schema by applying it to examples of published research.},

Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as a crucial 21st-century skill, enabling individuals to solve problems more effectively through an automation-oriented perspective and fundamental concepts of computer science. To ensure the effective integration of CT into educational curricula, it is crucial to develop efficient assessment frameworks that allow teachers to measure and promote student CT proficiency. Therefore, our aim is to develop a short test to measure CT among undergraduate students. To this end, we consider two performance tests: the Computational Thinking test (CTt) and the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA). We use items from both instruments to compile a short test. Based on a sample of 290 second-year non-computer science undergraduate students, we provide evidence on the quality of our test. Besides classical test theory, we apply item response theory, namely Rasch modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis. Our test shows favorable properties, e.g., Cronbach's alpha {$>$} .75, and may be suitable for the efficient assessment of CT across higher education programs.},

LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency.},

Using previous developed TML models, based on social cognitive theory and adaptive structuration meta-theory, the effectiveness of three training methods were examined in this study: technology mediated (using both vicarious and enactive learning), and collaborative and combined (collaborative plus technology mediated). The study also focused on the learning process. The experimental study results showed a significant positive influence of enactive learning enabled TML and collaborative training on specific training outcomes, and the combined training method shows positive results on all training outcomes. The study results also showed that faithful appropriation of the training methods during the learning process has a moderator effect on training outcomes. The study provides important research implications for theory and practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the "diversity curriculum infusion" course design process as applied within a Film/Video Directing class at the University of Missouri in Kansas City during the Spring 2006 semester. By custom, film directing has been grounded in aesthetic principles originating in Western European craft and art traditions. While students will continue to expect, and will need expertise in, these familiar "rules" of media creation, it is the objective of diversity curriculum infusion to introduce and invite applied consideration of non-western multicultural aesthetic alternatives in directing and production design. The challenge within the classroom is to present diverse cultural approaches to film and video creation to not only broaden the aesthetic awareness of future filmmakers but to also further define and delineate, by contrast and comparison with cultural alternatives, the deep and arbitrary structural characteristics of conventional western film form. The final course design, objectives, and topic schedule will be presented, along with an appraisal of how well the objectives have been met. A bibliography is included.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human communication and everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under suspicion of becoming able to deceive human operators and utilizing this ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a prerequisite to this, LLMs need to possess a conceptual understanding of deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, but were non-existent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs can alter their propensity to deceive. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine psychology.},

Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

  abstract = {An abundant amount of information is created and delivered over electronic media. Users risk becoming overwhelmed by the flow of information, and they lack adequate tools to help them manage the situation. Information filtering (IF) is one of the methods that is rapidly evolving to manage large information flows. The aim of IF is to expose users to only information that is relevant to them. Many IF systems have been developed in recent years for various application domains. Some examples of filtering applications are: filters for search results on the internet that are employed in the Internet software, personal e-mail filters based on personal profiles, listservers or newsgroups filters for groups or individuals, browser filters that block non-valuable information, filters designed to give children access them only to suitable pages, filters for e-commerce applications that address products and promotions to potential customers only, and many more. The different systems use various methods, concepts, and techniques from diverse research areas like: Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, or Behavioral Science. Various systems cover different scope, have divergent functionality, and various platforms. There are many systems of widely varying philosophies, but all share the goal of automatically directing the most valuable information to users in accordance with their User Model, and of helping them use their limited reading time most optimally. This paper clarifies the difference between IF systems and related systems, such as information retrieval (IR) systems, or Extraction systems. The paper defines a framework to classify IF systems according to several parameters, and illustrates the approach with commercial and academic systems. The paper describes the underlying concepts of IF systems and the techniques that are used to implement them. It discusses methods and measurements that are used for evaluation of IF systems and limitations of the current systems. In the conclusion we present research issues in the Information Filtering research arena, such as user modeling, evaluation standardization and integration with digital libraries and Web repositories.},

High quality factors and small mode volumes make acoustic modes ideal quantum memories, while the qubit-phonon coupling enables the initialization and manipulation of quantum states. We present a scheme for quantum computing with multimode quantum acoustic systems, and based on this scheme, propose a hardware-efficient implementation of a quantum random access memory (QRAM). Quantum information is stored in high-Q phonon modes, and couplings between modes are engineered by applying off-resonant drives to a transmon qubit. In comparison to existing proposals that involve directly exciting the qubit, this scheme can offer a substantial improvement in gate fidelity for long-lived acoustic modes. We show how these engineered phonon-phonon couplings can be used to access data in superposition according to the state of designated address modes-implementing a QRAM on a single chip.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing the best current thinking about learning, course design, and promoting student achievement, this is a guide to developing college instruction that has clear purpose, is well integrated into the curriculum, and improves student learning in predictable and measurable ways. The process involves developing a transparent course blueprint, focused on a limited number of key concepts and ideas, related tasks, and corresponding performance criteria; as well as on frequent practice opportunities, and early identification of potential learning barriers. "Idea-based Learning" takes as its point of departure the big conceptual ideas of a discipline that give structure and unity to a course and even to the curriculum, as opposed to a focus on content that can lead to teaching sequences of loosely-related topics; and aligns with notions of student-centered and outcomes-based learning environments. Adopting a backwards design model, it begins with three parallel processes: first, identifying the material that is crucial for conceptual understanding; second, articulating a clear rationale for how to choose learning outcomes based on student needs and intellectual readiness; and finally, aligning the learning outcomes with the instructional requirements of the authentic performance tasks. The resulting syllabi ensure cohesion between sections of the same course as well as between courses within a whole curriculum, assuring the progressive development of students' skills and knowledge. Key elements of IBL include: (1) Helping students see the big picture; (2) Building courses around one or more authentic performance tasks that illuminate the core concepts of the discipline; (3) Clearly identifying performance criteria for all tasks; (4) Incorporating practice in the competencies that are deemed important for students' success; (5) By placing the onus of learning on the student, liberating faculty to take on the role of learning coaches; and (6) Designing tasks that help students unlearn simplistic ideas and replace them with improved understandings. Edmund Hansen expertly guides the reader through the steps of the process, providing examples along the way, and concluding with a sample course design document and syllabus that illustrate the principles he propounds.},

  abstract = {In a recent issue of the Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Marakas, Johnson, and Clay (2007) presented an interesting and important discussion on formative versus reflective measurement, specifically related to the measurement of the computer self-efficacy (CSE) construct. However, we believe their recommendation to measure CSE constructs using formative indicators merits additional dialogue before being adopted by researchers. In the current study we discuss why the substantive theory underlying the CSE construct suggests that it is best measured using reflective indicators. We then provide empirical evidence demonstrating how the misspecification of existing CSE measures as formative can result in unstable estimates across varying endogenous variables and research contexts. Specifically, we demonstrate how formative indicator weights are dependent on the endogenous variable used to estimate them. Given that the strength of formative indicator weights is one metric used for determining indicator retention, and adding or dropping formative indicators can result in changes in the conceptual meaning of a construct, the use of formative measurement can result in the retention of different indicators and ultimately the measurement of different concepts across studies. As a result, the comparison of findings across studies over time becomes conceptually problematic and compromises our ability to replicate and extend research in a particular domain. We discuss not only the consequences of using formative versus reflective measures in CSE research but also the broader implications this choice has on research in other domains.

  abstract = {A computer-simulated software training system (CSSTS) delivers a specific form of computer-based training in which participants are allowed to select various training features within a simulated software environment. Given the growing use of these systems as end-user training (EUT) aids, there is a need for greater understanding of how participants use these systems, as well as whether participant-controlled learning environments are truly effective. The present research examines how a particular learner characteristic, software self-efficacy, drives appropriation in a high learner control, CSSTS environment. Contrary to notions in the literature, results from spreadsheet and database software training courses reveal that pre-training specific software self-efficacy constitutes a significant, negative predictor of faithful appropriations of the CSSTS. This research also establishes a positive relationship between faithful appropriation and increases in software self-efficacy (SSE). In essence, faithful appropriations lead to greater increases in SSE, which influences software skills performance. In addition, the research validates prior EUT research by extending prior findings to a database training environment. A psychometrically sound measure is put forth to capture database self-efficacy.    [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Abstract. The study of spatial presence is currently receiving increased attention in both media psychology and communication research. The present paper introduces the Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES), a short eight-item self-report measure. The SPES is derived from a process model of spatial presence ( Wirth et al., 2007 , Media Psychology, 9, 493--525), and assesses spatial presence as a two-dimensional construct that comprises a user's self-location and perceived possible actions in a media environment. The SPES is shorter than many other available spatial presence scales, and can be conveniently applied to diverse media settings. Two studies are reported (N               1               ~=~290, N               2               ~=~395) that confirm sound psychometric qualities for the SPES.},

  abstract = {Purpose - To improve the quality of field experience, support field experience cooperation and streamline field experience management, the purpose of this paper is to describe the experience in using Activity Theory to design and develop a web-based field experience tracking system for a special education program. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used Activity Theory to design and develop a web-based field experience tracking system for a special education program. An in-depth evaluation of the developed web-based system including usability testing and actual use of the system was conducted. Findings - The evaluation and data analysis results demonstrate the value of Activity Theory and show that a web-based tracking system is a valuable tool to support the management of pre-service teachers' field experiences. Originality/value - This is the first paper to discuss the design and development of field experience tracking system using Activity Theory. This paper can be used to motivate other developers to use Activity theory to design campus-wide information system. The system and methodology the authors used in this project has wider applicability and generalizability, and can be applied to the management of other competency and field based professional training in areas such as nursing, social work and medicine.},

  abstract = {Interfaces now employ a variety of media-rich, social, and advanced decision-making components, including recommendation agents (RA) designed to assist users with their tasks. Social presence has been identified as a key consideration in website design to overcome the lack of warmth, social cues, and face-to-face interaction, but few studies have investigated the interface features that may increase social presence. Recent research on RAs has similarly acknowledged social presence as a key factor in the design of online RAs and in building trust in this technology, but there has been limited empirical work on the topic. In this study an experiment was conducted to explore how social technology cues, media capabilities, and individual differences influence social presence and trust in an RA. RA personality (extraversion), vividness (text, voice, and animation), and computer playfulness were found to influence social presence, with social presence serving in a mediating role and increasing user trust in the RA. Vividness also had a moderating effect on the relationship between RA extraversion and social presence such that increased levels of vividness strengthen this relationship. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Previous researchers have identified desirable characteristics of instructional designers, but very little research has been published on the archetypes or models of these characteristics when compared to job roles instructional designers fill in higher education. The purpose of this sequential exploratory mixed methods study was to identify the job roles of instructional designers in higher education and to define archetypes for the identified job roles. The sequential exploratory mixed methods study added to the field of instructional design (ID) by identifying the job roles of instructional designers in higher education, utilizing the Repertory Grid Technique (RGIP) to identify desirable characteristics of instructional designers, and rate categories of the characteristics of the previous identified job roles. Research participants were instructional designers with at least three years of higher education ID experience. As a result of the study eight job roles instructional designers fill in higher education were identified, 14 categories of desirable characteristics were defined, and these categories were ranked and rated to determine their importance to each job role. The researcher confirmed archetypes for ID jobs in higher education exist. The results of the study are useful in the formal education, the hiring, and evaluation of job performance of instructional designers, and as another tool to measure the quality of online education. Additional research is recommended to determine how well instructional design education aligns to instructional design job roles and how much better do instructional designers perform when they possess the correct characteristics for their job role.},

This study compares what university teachers said they did to develop a course with a systematic instructional design/development process. Interviews were held with university faculty members to ascertain their course development processes. Comparison of their responses with recommendations by instructional developers using a systematic approach to course development showed differences in the way they talk about course development. Several factors prevent, to varying degrees, humanities professors from developing their courses according to the recommended processes: time to prepare, prior knowledge of student group, their desire to be flexible, and their desire to encourage students to be self-directed. A major constraint is the basic difference in approach to course development. University humanities faculty members operate under belief systems based on paradigms in some ways divergent from that of the paradigm under which the instructional developer operates. It may be for that reason, and the type of knowledge in use, that humanities professors are reluctant to utilize the systematic approach to developing their courses.},

  abstract = {Web personalization allows online merchants to customize Web content to serve the needs of individual customers. Using data mining and clickstream analysis techniques, merchants can now adapt website content in real time to capture the current preferences of online customers. Though the ability to offer adaptive content in real time opens up new business opportunities for online merchants, it also raises questions of timing. One question is when to present personalized content to consumers. Consumers prefer early presentation that eases their selection process, whereas adaptive systems can make better personalized content if they are allowed to collect more consumers' clicks over time. A review of personalization research confirms that little work has been done on these timing issues in the context of personalized services. The current study aims to fill that gap. Drawing on consumer search theory, we develop hypotheses about consumer responses to differences in presentation timing and recommendation type and the interaction between the two. The findings establish that quality improves over the course of an online session but the probability of considering and accepting a given recommendation diminishes over the course of the session. These effects are also shown to interact with consumer expertise, providing insights on the interplay between the different design elements of a personalization strategy.

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

However, interpreting and integrating information from data mining models can be challenging. The current research proposes a strategy to identify nonlinear and interaction effects by using a deductive data mining approach that in essence consists of comparing increasingly complex data mining models. The proposed approach is applied to 3 empirical data sets with details on how to interpret each step and model comparison, along with simulations providing a proof of concept. Annotated example code is also provided. Ultimately, the proposed deductive data mining approach provides a novel perspective on exploring interactions and nonlinear effects with the goal of model explanation and confirmation. Limitations of the current approach and future directions are also considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Setting high and specific goals is one of the best-established management tools to increase performance and motivation. However, in recent years, potential downsides of goal-setting are being discussed. One possible downside is the high risk of failing the goal. In an approach to integrate research on the consequences of goal-failure and the basic assumptions of goal-setting theory, we investigated whether failure of a high and specific goal has detrimental effects on a person's affect, self-esteem, and motivation. In Experiment 1, 185 participants received fictitious feedback about attaining or failing an assigned high and specific goal. In Experiment 2 with 86 participants, we manipulated goal-failure through task-difficulty and we included task choice as a behavioral measure of motivation. In both experiments, participants who failed the high and specific goal showed a decrease in affect, self-esteem, and motivation compared to participants who attained that goal. Results indicate that failing a high and specific goal can be damaging for self-related factors that may be crucial for organizational long-term outcomes. We advise organizations to consider potential undesirable effects when using goal-setting interventions.}

We used video analyses of the sessions to identify well-coordinated and poorly coordinated groups. Through user questionnaires, group members evaluated their work processes and products as well as the computer-supported environment. Writing experts independently rated the quality of the groups' final documents. We discovered that quality of coordination was strongly tied to groups' evaluations of their work processes, work products, and tools. Well-coordinated groups tended to be more efficient than poorly coordinated groups although we observed no differences in the quality of their documents. We also identify what coordination strategies lead to effective group work and offer suggestions for additional tools to facilitate coordination.

We explore each of the bias sources in detail in this article, including examples and links to related work, as well as potential counter-measures.},

To assess the efficiency and efficacy of the reviewing process, one essential element is to understand and evaluate the reviews themselves. In this work, we study the content and structure of peer reviews under the argument mining framework, through automatically detecting (1) argumentative propositions put forward by reviewers, and (2) their types (e.g., evaluating the work or making suggestions for improvement). We first collect 14.2K reviews from major machine learning and natural language processing venues. 400 reviews are annotated with 10,386 propositions and corresponding types of Evaluation, Request, Fact, Reference, or Quote. We then train state-of-the-art proposition segmentation and classification models on the data to evaluate their utilities and identify new challenges for this new domain, motivating future directions for argument mining. Further experiments show that proposition usage varies across venues in amount, type, and topic.},

What are components and elements that have been missed in current eEducation systems? How can we learn from past experience and lessons so that a conceptual framework could be proposed to design a better next generation eEducation system that could help universities and corporations to gain competitive advantages in a global education market?

Unlike most types of culture initiatives, a skills-based approach can more effectively infuse new culture components into scale-ups and international incumbents alike. This approach is particularly effective for developing what many refer to as soft skills, such as perspective taking. This ability to step outside one's own perspective to understand another person's point of view, motivations, and emotions helps build a psychologically safe environment in which people dare to share ideas and unfiltered information.},

  abstract = {The use of deep pre-trained bidirectional transformers has led to remarkable progress in a number of applications (Devlin et al., 2018). For tasks that make pairwise comparisons between sequences, matching a given input with a corresponding label, two approaches are common: Cross-encoders performing full self-attention over the pair and Bi-encoders encoding the pair separately. The former often performs better, but is too slow for practical use. In this work, we develop a new transformer architecture, the Poly-encoder, that learns global rather than token level self-attention features. We perform a detailed comparison of all three approaches, including what pre-training and fine-tuning strategies work best. We show our models achieve state-of-the-art results on three existing tasks; that Poly-encoders are faster than Cross-encoders and more accurate than Bi-encoders; and that the best results are obtained by pre-training on large datasets similar to the downstream tasks.},

However, prescriptive knowledge is considered to have no truth value in itself. Given this assumption, the validity of DSR outcomes can only be assessed by means of descriptive knowledge to be obtained at the conclusion of a DSR process. This is reflected in the build-evaluate pattern of current DSR methodologies. Recognizing the emergent nature of IT artifacts this build-evaluate pattern, however, poses unfavorable implications regarding the achievement of rigor within a DSR project. While it is vital in DSR to prove the usefulness of an artifact a rigorous DSR process also requires justifying and validating the artifact design itself even before it has been put into use. This paper proposes three principles for evaluating DSR artifacts which not only address the evaluation of an artifact's usefulness but also the evaluation of design decisions made to build an artifact. In particular, it is argued that by following these principles the prescriptive knowledge produced in DSR can be considered to have a truth-like value.},

  abstract = {The emergence of large language models has led to the development of powerful tools such as ChatGPT that can produce text indistinguishable from human-generated work. With the increasing accessibility of such technology, students across the globe may utilize it to help with their school work-a possibility that has sparked ample discussion on the integrity of student evaluation processes in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). To date, it is unclear how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses across various disciplines. Further, students' perspectives regarding the use of such tools in school work, and educators' perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art tool, ChatGPT, against that of students on 32 university-level courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a global survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors' institution, to discern students' and educators' perceptions of ChatGPT's use in school work. We find that ChatGPT's performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of students in a multitude of courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT's use in school work, due to both their propensity to classify human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the relative ease with which AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, there seems to be an emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat its use as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy discussions addressing the integration of artificial intelligence into educational frameworks.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in natural language generation (NLG) using neural language models have brought us closer than ever to the goal of building AI-powered creative writing tools. However, most prior work on human-AI collaboration in the creative writing domain has evaluated new systems with amateur writers, typically in contrived user studies of limited scope. In this work, we commissioned 13 professional, published writers from a diverse set of creative writing backgrounds to craft stories using Wordcraft, a text editor with built-in AI-powered writing assistance tools. Using interviews and participant journals, we discuss the potential of NLG to have significant impact in the creative writing domain--especially with respect to brainstorming, generation of story details, world-building, and research assistance. Experienced writers, more so than amateurs, typically have well-developed systems and methodologies for writing, as well as distinctive voices and target audiences. Our work highlights the challenges in building for these writers; NLG technologies struggle to preserve style and authorial voice, and they lack deep understanding of story contents. In order for AI-powered writing assistants to realize their full potential, it is essential that they take into account the diverse goals and expertise of human writers.},

  abstract = {Using a computer-based learning environment, the present paper studied the effects of adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback on the learning outcomes of secondary school students in a financial education program. We randomly assigned schools to four conditions on a crossing of two factors: the type of instruction (uniform or adaptive) and feedback (verification or elaborated). A total of 1,177 students in 32 schools completed the program in ability groups in the classroom. The results showed that the program, on average, enhanced the financial knowledge of students by almost half of a standard deviation. No significant changes in students' financial behavior were found. Despite the promise of adaptive practices to address the individual needs of students, we observed no additional learning gains associated with adaptive instruction and elaborated feedback. A marginally significant heterogeneous effect for gender was reported, where girls were negatively affected by adaptive instruction. Moreover, despite our sample included more students from a favorable socioeconomic status, the adaptive practices seemed to lower the motivation level. Hence, while no information on the time spent on the instruction and feedback was retrieved, the latter finding suggested that the practices may have been perceived as burdensome by students, thereby rendering them ineffective.},

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra},

  abstract = {Loneliness is a growing public health problem. Lonely individuals show a characteristic negative bias in the cognitive processing of socioemotional information. In the current study, we tested the effects of a novel computerized feedback-based interpretation training on socioemotional information processing. Lonely and non-lonely participants were assigned equally to training groups. During interpretation training, the promotion training group learned to associate subthreshold fearful and neutral expressions with socially more favorable labels than less favorable ones. The control training group learned to associate the same facial expressions with socially less favorable labels. After training, participants performed three socioemotional tasks. Results revealed that promotion training reduced associations between loneliness and recognition of anger and fear in lonely participants. In addition, compared to control training, promotion training significantly increased the likelihood of evaluating surprise expressions as positive rather than negative. This positive evaluation bias toward surprise faces increased in lonely participants with greater promotion learning. However, only non-lonely participants showed increased willingness to approach an unfamiliar female face after promotion training relative to control training. Despite this limitation, the findings demonstrate the potential of our novel feedback-based interpretation training in mitigating characteristic processing of socioemotional information among lonely people.},

  abstract = {Peer assessment is an effective and efficient pedagogical strategy for delivering feedback to learners. Asking students to provide quality feedback, which contains suggestions and mentions problems, can promote metacognition by reviewers and better assist reviewees in revising their work. Thus, various supervised machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect quality feedback. However, all these powerful algorithms have the same Achilles' heel: the reliance on sufficient historical data. In other words, collecting adequate peer feedback for training a supervised algorithm can take several semesters before the model can be deployed to a new class. In this paper, we present a new paradigm, called incremental zero-shot learning (IZSL), to tackle the problem of lacking sufficient historical data. Our results show that the method can achieve acceptable ``cold-start'' performance without needing any domain data, and it outperforms BERT when trained on the same data collected incrementally.},

Augmenting LLMs with long-term memory (LTM) presents an opportunity to improve engagement and self-disclosure, but we lack an understanding of how LTM impacts people's interaction with LLM-driven chatbots in public health interventions. We examine the case of CareCall -- an LLM-driven voice chatbot with LTM -- through the analysis of 1,252 call logs and interviews with nine users. We found that LTM enhanced health disclosure and fostered positive perceptions of the chatbot by offering familiarity. However, we also observed challenges in promoting self-disclosure through LTM, particularly around addressing chronic health conditions and privacy concerns. We discuss considerations for LTM integration in LLM-driven chatbots for public health monitoring, including carefully deciding what topics need to be remembered in light of public health goals.},

  abstract = {Many interesting but practically intractable problems can be reduced to that of finding the ground state of a system of interacting spins; however, finding such a ground state remains computationally difficult. It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing. If it could be harnessed, quantum annealing might improve on known methods for solving certain types of problem. However, physical investigation of quantum annealing has been largely confined to microscopic spins in condensed-matter systems. Here we use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprising an array of eight superconducting flux quantum bits with programmable spin-spin couplings. We observe a clear signature of quantum annealing, distinguishable from classical thermal annealing through the temperature dependence of the time at which the system dynamics freezes. Our implementation can be configured in situ to realize a wide variety of different spin networks, each of which can be monitored as it moves towards a low-energy configuration. This programmable artificial spin network bridges the gap between the theoretical study of ideal isolated spin networks and the experimental investigation of bulk magnetic samples. Moreover, with an increased number of spins, such a system may provide a practical physical means to implement a quantum algorithm, possibly allowing more-effective approaches to solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems.},

Study Two examined the role of visual anonymity in encouraging self-disclosure during CMC. Visually anonymous participants disclosed significantly more information about themselves than non-visually anonymous participants. In Study Three, private and public self-awareness were independently manipulated, using video-conferencing cameras and accountability cues, to create a 2\,{\texttimes}\,2 design public self-awareness (high and low){\texttimes}private self-awareness (high and low).

  abstract = {Instruction at a distance is rapidly becoming one of the most widely used modes for teaching post-secondary learners. One of the distinctive characteristics of distance education is the emphasis on course development and the models of course development which have evolved. To date, however, the literature offers little understanding of the knowledge bases upon which current practice in distance education course development is based. Expertise in course development has not been characterized in any systematic way, and it is not known how novice and expert DE course developers differ in the way they conceptualize and go about course development. Even less is known about how course developers move toward expertise and from where they draw their understanding. The primary purpose of this study is to begin the investigation of these questions, based on data collected from multiple sources and contexts. Qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data on the reflections of the course design process by nine participants. Participants varied in their experience level, the level of course they designed, and their role in the design process. Participants took part in a semi-structured interview and were asked to provide written responses to a practical design critique exercise. Themes or issues were allowed to emerge from the data, and were characterized along three main topics: the learner, design decisions, and evaluation. Differences between novices and more experienced participants were observed in their depth of understanding about the learner, the influence of theoretical constructs on their making design decisions, and the influence of context on the design process.},

  abstract = {The adoption of information systems (IS) is often explained in terms of usefulness and ease of use. Lately, researchers have begun to recognize that a hedonic streak in human beings provides a further contributing factor in the adoption and acceptance of information systems. Embedded in this streak is a broader social aspect that incorporates not only the solitary individual pleasure one gets from using the system, but also the pleasure that one gets from interacting and socializing with others through the system. This becomes particularly evident in virtual environments that support high levels of interaction with others and with artifacts embedded in an immersive context. By drawing on IS theories of technology acceptance and IS success, and on theories of social interaction from evolutionary psychology, activity theory, situated action, and distributed cognition, researchers test the construction of sociability and its antecedents in Second Life -- a popular virtual environment. The results support that, a social component contributes to IS usage.},

In the 1st study (N{\enspace}={\enspace}612), college students' help-seeking tendencies, given the prospect of poor performance, were (a) directly related to their rated likelihood of engaging in instrumental achievement activities, (b) directly related to persistent global self-esteem, and (c) inversely related to students' perceptions that seeking help is threatening. In Study 2 (N{\enspace}={\enspace}541), help seeking was directly related to the use of cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management learning strategies. Study 3 (N{\enspace}={\enspace}386) replicated the results of Study 2 and also found that correlations between help seeking and learning strategy use were unchanged when controlling for individual differences in the perceived threat to self-esteem posed by help seeking. Evidence from all 3 studies is consistent with viewing help seeking in an academic context as an achievement-related rather than as a dependent behavior.

To tackle this problem, there exist several training approaches aimed at changing employees' behavior. However, the extant literature does not examine the elementary characteristics of IS security training, such as the ways in which IS security training differs from other forms of training. We argue that IS security training needs a theory that both lays down these elementary characteristics and explains how these characteristics shape IS security training principles in practice. We advance a theory that suggests that IS security training has certain elementary characteristics that separate it from other forms of training, and we set a fundamental direction for IS security training practices. Second, the theory defines four pedagogical requirements for designing and evaluating IS security training approaches. We point out that no existing IS security training approach meets all of these requirements and demonstrate how to design an IS security training approach that does meet these requirements. Implications for research and practice are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

A critical examination and comparison of past times'`traditional' and present-day `web-based' development shows that contemporary ISD can be seen as an accentuated evolution -- rather than a revolution -- of well-known challenges and solutions. On this basis, (1) diversity; (2) knowledge; and (3) structure are identified as inherent and interrelated problems, while the practices for coping with these three challenges are (a) organization and specialization; (b) constant verbal communication and negotiation; and (c) pragmatic application of certain development methods and methodical concepts. We conclude that more research on the occurrence and interaction of problems and practices at, and between, different contextual levels (e.g. the business environment, company, project, team and individual levels) is needed to understand and assess (the gap between) `observed practice' and `good practice' across the many types of Web and non-Web ISD projects conducted today. We outline a possible research agenda to investigate these issues.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with managing e-learning communities. It reports on the process and methods adopted in an EU project called MEDFORIST. The challenges of managing this project were considerable because there was significant social diversity amongst the e-leaning community members. The paper outlines some key principles derived from teleology (or, the 'study of purpose') that were used to structure some key aspects of the management of the e-learning group processes. These principles were developed and used, in order to structure enquiring activities to inform the design, monitoring and evaluation activities in the provision of e-learning group processes. The paper outlines the use of such enquiry as a foundation for the continued development of the application of e-learning in contexts in which divergent human groups come together in unstructured, non-prescriptive human learning activities. As such, the paper outlines some key methodological requirements for managing e-learning group processes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Study participants used the eHealth system for a 12-month period after diagnosis in an attempt to acquire an understanding about their diabetes, develop self-care activities (e.g., blood glucose testing), and improve their biomedical outcomes. Drawing upon theories and methods from information systems and upon the Precede-Proceed model of health promotion planning, we explored the double adoption of eHealth technology and its antecedents, self-care practices and their antecedents, and improvements in biomedical outcomes important to long-term diabetes health. Path model results indicate important implications for information systems, eHealth, and health promotion practice and research, which are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

However, the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the influential factors that play a key role in the effective implementation of online peer feedback. This systematic review provides an overview of the current state of online peer feedback implementation in higher education contexts and explores the role of students' characteristics and online learning environments in relation to their learning processes and outcomes. To achieve this goal, the PRISMA method was followed, and a coding scheme was developed to create a framework that can guide the implementation of online peer feedback in higher education settings. This framework depicts factors that should be taken into account for effective implementation of online peer feedback in terms of four dimensions: students' characteristics (demographic characteristics, academic background, and personality and psychological features), environmental conditions (learning platform and setting), learning processes (content, feedback activity design, and technology), and learning outcomes including cognitive outcomes (e.g., acquisition of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation), behavioral outcomes (engagement, communication, and teamwork), and affective outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, sense of autonomy, and confidence). We conclude this study by discussing the framework, limitations, and ideas for future research and practice.},

The goals were to describe how the new measure of online student characteristics (i.e., TOOLS --- Test of Online Learning Success) was constructed and validated, outline the contributions the measure has made to our knowledge of online learners, and review the research literature that supports the findings. The results demonstrated the measure's simple and stable structure, construct validity, criterion validity, internal reliable, and test--retest reliability. The measure, administration guidelines, scoring procedures, and outcome interpretations are provided in the public domain. The different purposes for which the measure may be used are discussed.

Yet there is little research on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce that takes a longitudinal approach. Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome. The results indicate that trust directly and indirectly affects a consumer's purchase decision in combination with perceived risk and perceived benefit, and also that trust has a longer term impact on consumer e-loyalty through satisfaction. Thus, this study extends our understanding of consumer Internet transaction behavior as a three-fold (prepurchase, purchase, and postpurchase) process, and it recognizes the crucial, multiple roles that trust plays in this process. Implications for theory and practice as well as limitations and future directions are discussed.},

RESULTS  Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in 112 of 563 (19.9\%) patients who underwent the trio test. With trio test results, the overall diagnostic yield increased by 5.4\% (112/2,059). Of 165 de novo variants detected, 149 were pathogenic and we detected 85 novel pathogenic variants. Pathogenic, de novo variants were frequently detected in CDKL5, ATP1A3, and STXBP1.  CONCLUSION  The trio test is an efficient method for genetically diagnosing NDD. We identified specific situations where a certain trio test is more appropriate, thereby providing a guide for clinicians when confronted with variants of unknown significance of specific genes.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.  Published as a conference paper at the 3rd International Conference for Learning Representations, San Diego, 2015},

The three legends can be seen as variations on one central theme, namely, that it is the learner who knows best and that she or he should be the controlling force in her or his learning. The first legend is one of learners as digital natives who form a generation of students knowing by nature how to learn from new media, and for whom ``old'' media and methods used in teaching/learning no longer work. The second legend is the widespread belief that learners have specific learning styles and that education should be individualized to the extent that the pedagogy of teaching/learning is matched to the preferred style of the learner. The final legend is that learners ought to be seen as self-educators who should be given maximum control over what they are learning and their learning trajectory. It concludes with a possible reason why these legends have taken hold, are so pervasive, and are so difficult to eradicate.},

We propose named entity recognition (NER; i.e., the automatic identification and extraction of information from text) to model three established theoretical principles: (i) truth tellers provide accounts that are richer in detail, (ii) contain more contextual references (specific persons, locations, and times), and (iii) deceivers tend to withhold potentially checkable information. We test whether NER captures these theoretical concepts and can automatically identify truthful versus deceptive hotel reviews. We extracted the proportion of named entities with two NER tools (spaCy and Stanford's NER) and compared the discriminative ability to a lexicon word count approach (LIWC) and a measure of sentence specificity (speciteller). Named entities discriminated truthful from deceptive hotel reviews above chance level, and outperformed the lexicon approach and sentence specificity. This investigation suggests that named entities may be a useful addition to existing automated verbal deception detection approaches.},

In two successive semesters, we presented the same course syllabus using different teaching styles: in fall 2003, the traditional lecture format; and in spring 2004, decreased lecturing and addition of student participation and cooperative problem solving during class time, including frequent in-class assessment of understanding. We used performance on pretests and posttests, and on homework problems to estimate and compare student learning gains between the two semesters. Our results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the more interactive course. To assess reproducibility of these effects, we repeated the interactive course in spring 2005 with similar results. Our findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other disciplines. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a general model for teaching large biology courses that incorporates interactive engagement and cooperative work in place of some lecturing, while retaining course content by demanding greater student responsibility for learning outside of class.},

  abstract = {In the last 15 years there has been little research about the design of resident assistant (RA) training programs in higher education (Bowman \& Bowman, 1995, 1998; Wesolowski, Bowman, \& Adams, 1996). A RA is an enrolled student who is selected, trained, and supervised to serve as a part-time, paraprofessional employee for a housing and/or residential life department at a college or university. The lack of research was surprising given the time, effort, and institutional resources invested in employing, training, and supervising RAs. The purpose of this study was to explore how contemporary RA training programs were designed and the education and professional development of those responsible for designing the program as well as to explore the extent to which RA training designers used elements of integrated course design to create significant learning experiences (Fink, 2003). The study was guided by three research questions: (a) How are RA contemporary RA training programs designed? (b) Are RA training programs designed to produce significant learning experiences? (c) Do RA educators use knowledge of curriculum design to develop RA training programs? The unit of analysis for this cross-sectional study was training programs designed for students serving as RAs for the 2010-11 academic year. With permission of Robert Bowman, many questions from his original study were incorporated into a comprehensive, 52-question web-based survey. The survey was distributed via email in fall 2011 to representatives from 805 higher education institutions located in the United States who were members of the Association of College and University Housing Officers, International professional association and received a 41.9\% response rate. The data analysis was largely descriptive in nature. This study yielded a number of major findings. First, designers of RA training programs largely used an instructional paradigm, rather than a learning paradigm which has been advocated by leaders in higher education. Second, while many designers of RA education programs said they used an approach similar to integrated course designusing a variety of teaching and learning activities, plans for feedback and assessment, significant learning goals, and situational factorsthere was little evidence that it was widely used. Third, perhaps a learner-centered approach is lacking because, as revealed in this research, few RA educators completed coursework and professional development in curricular design. Fourth, the rise of safety and security issues covered in RA training programs displaced equally important topics related to multicultural understanding and community development. Lastly, in sum, this research provided a detailed description of contemporary RA training programs. In closing, I challenged that RA educators cannot develop effective, learner-centered, RA education programs without the encouragement and support of senior student affairs officers, professional associations, post-baccalaureate higher education programs, and other RA educators and proposed a number of measures that must be taken in order to ensure success. I also offered recommendations for future research. Finally, in my concluding comments I proposed a vision for future RA training programs.},

Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that "negated" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such "negative" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers.},

Over the past decades, an extensive body of empirical research has tested the theory, refined its key tenets, and broadened its applications. Yet, empirical results on the effects of performance feedback often vary and even produce conflicting insights that are difficult to interpret. Following recent developments, we suggest that empirical controversies can be largely reconciled once we consider different performance feedback conditions, organizational actions, and boundary conditions. We conducted a meta-analytic review of 113 empirical studies to statistically evaluate how and why the effects of performance feedback may vary according to various factors. By identifying factors shaping organizational responses to performance feedback, this study helps integrate existing empirical evidence and offers new directions for future theoretical development and empirical research.

  abstract = {Teams of people working together for a common purpose have been a centerpiece of human social organization ever since our ancient ancestors first banded together to hunt game, raise families, and defend their communities. Human history is largely a story of people working together in groups to explore, achieve, and conquer. Yet, the modern concept of work in large organizations that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is largely a tale of work as a collection of individual jobs. A variety of global forces unfolding over the last two decades, however, has pushed organizations worldwide to restructure work around teams, to enable more rapid, flexible, and adaptive responses to the unexpected. This shift in the structure of work has made team effectiveness a salient organizational concern.             Teams touch our lives everyday and their effectiveness is important to well-being across a wide range of societal functions. There is over 50 years of psychological research---literally thousands of studies---focused on understanding and influencing the processes that underlie team effectiveness. Our goal in this monograph is to sift through this voluminous literature to identify what we know, what we think we know, and what we need to know to improve the effectiveness of work groups and teams.             We begin by defining team effectiveness and establishing the conceptual underpinnings of our approach to understanding it. We then turn to our review, which concentrates primarily on topics that have well-developed theoretical and empirical foundations, to ensure that our conclusions and recommendations are on firm footing. Our review begins by focusing on cognitive, motivational/affective, and behavioral team processes---processes that enable team members to combine their resources to resolve task demands and, in so doing, be effective. We then turn our attention to identifying interventions, or ``levers,'' that can shape or align team processes and thereby provide tools and applications that can improve team effectiveness. Topic-specific conclusions and recommendations are given throughout the review. There is a solid foundation for concluding that there is an emerging science of team effectiveness and that findings from this research foundation provide several means to improve team effectiveness. In the concluding section, we summarize our primary findings to highlight specific research, application, and policy recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of work groups and teams.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Providing feedback is a technique to promote health behavior that is emphasized by behavior change theories. However, these theories make contradicting predictions regarding the effect of the feedback sign-that is, whether the feedback signals success or failure. Thus, it is unclear whether positive or negative feedback leads to more favorable behavior change in a health behavior intervention.  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the feedback sign in a health behavior change intervention.  METHODS  Data from participants (N=1623) of a 6-month physical activity intervention was used. Participants received a feedback email at the beginning of each month. Feedback was either positive or negative depending on the participants' physical activity in the previous month. In an exploratory analysis, change in monthly step count averages was used to evaluate the feedback effect.  RESULTS  The feedback sign did not predict the change in monthly step count averages over the course of the intervention (b=-84.28, P=.28). Descriptive differences between positive and negative feedback can be explained by regression to the mean.  CONCLUSIONS  The feedback sign might not influence the effect of monthly feedback emails sent out to participants of a large-scale physical activity intervention. However, randomized studies are needed to further support this conclusion. Limitations as well as opportunities for future research are discussed.},

We address this question by operationalizing information acquisition and entertainment as the use of the World Wide Web and interpersonal communication as the use of electronic mail (e-mail), and examine how 229 members of 110 households used these services during their first year on the Internet. The results show that e-mail drives people's use of the Internet. Participants used e-mail in more Internet sessions and more consistently than they used the World Wide Web, and they used e-mail first in sessions where they used both. Participants used the Internet more after they had used e-mail heavily, but they used the Internet less after they had used the Web heavily. While participants' use of both e-mail and the Web declined with time, the decline in Web use was steeper. Those who used e-mail more than they used the Web were also more likely to continue using the Internet over the course of a year. Our findings have implications for engineering and policies for the Internet and, more generally, for studies of the social impact of new technology.(Interpersonal Communication; Family Communication; Social Impact; Computer-Mediated Communication; Internet; World Wide Web; Online Services; User Studies; Technology Adoption; E-Mail; Electronic Mail) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]    Copyright of Information Systems Research is the property of INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

First, it is shown that results of quantitative summaries of the literature, such as Hanushek (1997), depend critically on whether studies are accorded equal weight. When studies are given equal weight, resources are systematically related to student achievement. When weights are in proportion to their number of estimates, resources and achievements are not systematically related. Second, a cost-benefit analysis of class size reduction is performed. Results of the Tennessee STAR class-size experiment suggest that the internal rate of return from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is around 6\%.},

  abstract = {One point of convergence in the many recent discussions on design science research in information systems (DSRIS) has been the desirability of a directive design theory (ISDT) as one of the outputs from a DSRIS project. However, the literature on theory development in DSRIS is very sparse. In this paper, we develop a framework to support theory development in DSRIS and explore its potential from multiple perspectives. The framework positions ISDT in a hierarchy of theories in IS design that includes a type of theory for describing how and why the design functions: Design-relevant explanatory/predictive theory (DREPT). DREPT formally captures the translation of general theory constructs from outside IS to the design realm. We introduce the framework from a knowledge representation perspective and then provide typological and epistemological perspectives. We begin by motivating the desirability of both directive-prescriptive theory (ISDT) and explanatory-predictive theory (DREPT) for IS design science research and practice. Since ISDT and DREPT are both, by definition, mid-range theories, we examine the notion of mid-range theory in other fields and then in the specific context of DSRIS. We position both types of theory in Gregor's (2006) taxonomy of IS theory in our typological view of the framework. We then discuss design theory semantics from an epistemological view of the framework, relating it to an idealized design science research cycle. To demonstrate the potential of the framework for DSRIS, we use it to derive ISDT and DREPT from two published examples of DSRIS. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {This research examined whether the informational advantage of an animation over a static picture (and over no visualizations as a control condition) can be compensated by presenting the information in the text that constitutes this informational advantage. In addition, it was investigated whether learners' spatial abilities acted as a compensator in learning with a static picture compared to an animation. Moreover, the underlying cognitive processes were explored by eye tracking measures. Two hundred and one university students were randomly assigned to one to six conditions resulting from a 2 {\texttimes} 3 between-subjects design with text information (with vs. without dynamic information) and visualization format (no visualization vs. static picture vs. animation) as independent variables and spatial abilities as continuous factor. For learning outcomes, results revealed that, other than expected, text information did not moderate learning with the different visualization formats. However, learners receiving visualizations significantly outperformed learners in the control conditions, and learners receiving animations significantly outperformed learners receiving static pictures in a transfer test. An analysis of the eye tracking data revealed that this beneficial effect of animations over static pictures was mediated by a pupillometry measure that is supposed to reflect effortful cognitive processing. Spatial abilities acted as a compensator in learning with the two visualization formats: The advantage of animations was particularly evident for learners with low spatial abilities, but not for learners with high spatial abilities. These results indicate that the informational advantage of animations over static pictures cannot easily be compensated through text information, but by learners' spatial abilities.

  abstract = {One of the most important application areas of molecular quantum chemistry is the study and prediction of chemical reactivity. Large-scale, fully error-tolerant quantum computers could provide exact or near-exact solutions to the underlying electronic structure problem with exponentially less effort than a classical computer thus enabling highly accurate predictions for comparably large molecular systems. In the nearer future, however, only "noisy" devices with a limited number of qubits that are subject to decoherence will be available. For such near-term quantum computers the hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver algorithm in combination with the unitary coupled-cluster ansatz (UCCSD-VQE) [ Peruzzo et al. Nat. Commun. 2014 , 5 , 4213 and McClean et al. New J. Phys. 2016 , 18 , 023023 ] has become an intensively discussed approach that could provide accurate results before the dawn of error-tolerant quantum computing. In this work we present an implementation of UCCSD-VQE that allows for the first time to treat both open- and closed-shell molecules. We study the accuracy of the obtained energies for nine small molecular systems as well as for four exemplary chemical reactions by comparing to well-established electronic structure methods like (nonunitary) coupled-cluster and density functional theory. Finally, we roughly estimate the required quantum hardware resources to obtain "useful" results for practical purposes.},

A total of 376 students enrolled in a HyFlex information systems course responded to an online questionnaire. One-way ANOVA tests results revealed that no significant differences were found between students who chose different delivery modes on satisfaction, multiple choice test, and written exam scores. However, significant differences were observed on continuous assessment scores...}

  abstract = {A great deal of popular literature exists on the subject of change and the leadership required to guide organizations through a change process. There is also scholarly work on organizational change in education and on leadership in the academic arena, but very little research is focused on specific experiences of those engaged in a change process within a higher education setting. This single-case qualitative study uses multiple data sources (interviews and archive documents) to identify and describe the experiences and perceptions of participants involved in a collaborative technology project between a state land grant university and a large, urban community college. The study explores the areas of agreement and disagreement among participant groups to discern patterns regarding organizational change and leadership. Among results reported in this study are perceptions and experiences of faculty, staff, and project managers pertaining to changes in the project purpose and individual role changes. Faculty and staff reported feeling confused and disengaged as a result of these changes, noting poor communication about such changes on the part of project managers. Faculty and staff also reported a desire for concrete project management tools such as timelines, specific deliverables, and budgetary and resource guidelines. There was disagreement among the groups regarding appropriate roles for faculty in such technology endeavors. Faculty and staff preferred that faculty contribute their discipline-area content without being held responsible for learning new technology skills or instructional design and pedagogy concepts. Project managers took the position that faculty should be accountable for at least some baseline technology skills and knowledge of pedagogy sufficient to aid in course redesign. While there was disagreement in terms of degree, all participants saw an important role for institutions to play in technology infusion projects. They called for resources to be made available such as faculty release time, technology training, robust systems and networks, and an institutional layer of proficient staff to provide support for both faculty and students in the transition to technology-mediated teaching and learning. The study concludes with observations about the implications of the research findings and recommendations for further study.},

  abstract = {Expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) posits that expectations, disconfirmation, and performance influence customer satisfaction. While information systems researchers have adopted EDT to explain user information technology (IT) satisfaction, they often use various EDT model subsets. Leaving out one or more key variables, or key relationships among the variables, can reduce EDT's explanatory potential. It can also suggest an intervention for practice that is very different from (and inferior to) the intervention suggested by a more complete model. Performance is an especially beneficial but largely neglected EDT construct in IT research. Using EDT theory from the marketing literature, this paper explains and demonstrates the incremental value of using the complete IT EDT model with performance versus the simplified model without it. Studying software users, we find that the complete model with performance both reveals assimilation effects for less experienced users and uncovers asymmetric effects not found in the simplified model. We also find that usefulness performance more strongly influences usage continuance intention than does any other EDT variable. We explain how researchers and practitioners can take full advantage of the predictive and explanatory power of the complete IT EDT model. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

However, the need to demonstrate the validity of the research process and outcomes has not received as much attention. This research examines scientific approaches to validity and their applicability to, and use in, design science. To do so, we assembled an extensive data set of research validities articles from various disciplines, as well as design science articles. We then examined the use of validity concepts in these articles and how these concepts could be employed to describe what validity means for design science research. The result is a design science research validity framework to guide how validity can become an integral aspect of design science research.},

  abstract = {We conduct an experiment to examine how providing decision makers with high versus low peer performance information influences choices between exploration and exploitation. Previous work on organization-level learning suggests that a high-performing peer would fuel exploration, whereas a low-performing peer would dampen it. In line with this, we find that individuals who receive information about a high-performing peer explore more than those who receive information about a low-performing peer. However, we also find that compared to individuals with a low tendency to self-enhance, individuals with a high tendency to self-enhance are less likely to explore when receiving information about a high-performing peer. In fact, these individuals explore at levels comparable to those who receive information about a low-performing peer. We explain this behavioral pattern by demonstrating that as individuals learn and improve, information about a high-performing peer increasingly results in mixed performance feedback; under these conditions of relative interpretive flexibility, exploration is moderated by decision makers' tendency to self-enhance. When these individual dynamics are aggregated, our data suggest that an organization that provides peer performance information may experience either the same or less exploration than an organization that does not, with the exact difference depending on its proportion of high self-enhancers. These insights into the contingencies and aggregate effects of how individuals interpret and respond to peer performance information are particularly relevant given recent interest in designing organizations that shape employee behavior through the provision of feedback rather than through traditional instruments of coordination and control, such as incentives or hierarchy.

This is surprising, given that service employees are an important determinant of service firms' success. This article examines the effects of real-time performance feedback on employees' service performance and investigates both how and under what conditions timely feedback encourages employees' engagement. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments test the conceptual model and the proposed hypotheses. A field experiment uses real customer feedback gathered after interaction with the app-chat of a large telecommunications provider. It tests the effect of feedback timing on service employees' performance and also examines the effect of feedback timing on their engagement. A subsequent scenario-based experiment then investigates the influence of selected moderators on the feedback timing--engagement relationship. Findings This article finds that real-time feedback leads to greater service performance than subsequent feedback. Furthermore, real-time feedback positively affects service employee engagement through the perceived controllability of the feedback and the service situation. Finally, feedback valence, task goals, individuals' need for closure (NCL), and gender interact with feedback timing to influence employee engagement. Originality/value This research investigates the potential of real-time performance feedback for service firms, combines and extends a variety of literature streams, and provides recommendations for the future management of service employees.},

  abstract = {My dissertation research aims to develop a comprehensive account for the current state of online higher education beyond the common social and educational expectations about the adoption of online education. Online education, according to dominant discourses in higher education, is commonly expected to (a) enhance educational accessibility to university education and (b) improve the quality of university instruction. And, this expectation further produces an imperative for its rapid adoption across all higher education institutions. However, my research fundamentally challenges these two rhetorical discourses, by providing an in-depth description of the disjunction between such discourses and the realities of praxis. Drawing on key concepts from Michel Foucault and Mikhail Bakhtin, I trace the historical development of these two discourses as two institutional principles of openness and innovation in an open university. The complex relationships between the institutional discourses and peoples practices, mediated by multiple factors are carefully addressed. My analysis reveals that multiple understandings of openness and innovation co-exist within the university, and members take different pedagogical approaches to online education according to their own understanding of those two principles. As a result, openness and innovation often conflict with each other at the operational level, and the conflict is also visible within the ongoing struggles between instructors and learning designers, with regard to the adoption of a particular form of online pedagogical practices. In summary, my findings demonstrate how the adoption of online education may introduce new problems and potentially oppressive power relationships among stakeholders in higher education, unlike the rhetorical claims that simply promote online education as a revolutionary solution for diverse social and educational problems. This disjunction continues to increase and is intensified by the existing instructional theory-practice gap in the academic field of online higher education. I urge that researchers and educators in online higher education as a united group, to make a collective effort to better understand and resolve the ongoing conflicts among the stakeholders and ultimately better serve our online students.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study develops and validates a scale to measure social media influencers' intimate self-disclosure (SMIs' ISD), by accessing consumer perceptions of the intimacy levels of SMIs' self-disclosure. The authors further evaluate the extent to which SMIs' ISD fosters consumers' self-brand connections via consumer-SMI parasocial relationships. Design/methodology/approach The scale was developed through item generation, purification, and validation. First, items were generated from existing scales and revised based on feedback provided by experts. The items were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using an online survey with 433 participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the predictive power of SMIs' ISD on parasocial relationships and self-brand connections. Findings The results suggest that the perceived SMIs' ISD is a unidimensional construct. As proposed, SMIs' ISD enhances consumer-brand connections through the underlying mechanism of consumers' sense of being in a parasocial relationship with an SMI. Originality/value This study advances self-disclosure and influencer marketing literature by addressing the lack of measures on SMIs' ISD from a consumer perspective and the scarcity of empirical understanding of how brands can profit from SMIs' capabilities to make intimate self-disclosure. Based on the literature review, this study is the first to empirically consider factual, emotional, and cognitive intimacy to develop scale and demonstrate the importance of SMIs' ISD in developing consumers' self-brand connections.}

In a series of studies (N = 8,693), adult participants played a game after receiving performance advice from previous participants. Although advice from the best-performing advisors was no more beneficial than advice from other advisors, participants believed that it had been-and they believed this despite the fact that they were told nothing about their advisors' performance. Why? The best performers did not give better advice, but they did give more of it, and participants apparently mistook quantity for quality. These studies suggest that performing and advising may often be unrelated skills and that in at least some domains, people may overvalue advice from top performers.},

A dynamic systems perspective can help to explain the underlying complementarity between stability and change in these forms. Following theories of emotional development, a model is presented in which cognition-emotion interactions are the vehicle for personality and social development. The model suggests that positive feedback between cognition and emotion generates, maintains, and reconfigures self-organizing interpretations of emotion-eliciting events at both microdevelopmental and macrodevelopmental time scales. Interpretations emerge and stabilize through the coupling of cognitive and emotional elements that are activated and reactivated by this feedback. Personality and behavior self-organize in response to critical fluctuations, amplified by feedback, and trace diverging paths through periods of stability and change. Stability resides in interpretive \emph{attractors }that maintain their organization by perpetuating as well as resolving emotional disequilibrium.},

Rather than binary judgements, we introduce a specificity scale which accommodates nuanced judgements. Our augmented annotation procedure also allows us to define where in the discourse context the lack of specificity can be resolved. In addition, the cause of the underspecification is annotated in the form of free text questions. We present results from a pilot annotation with this new scheme and demonstrate good inter-annotator agreement. We found that the lack of specificity distributes evenly among immediate prior context, long distance prior context and no prior context. We find that missing details that are not resolved in the the prior context are more likely to trigger questions about the reason behind events, ``why'' and ``how''.

Drawing on regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), we argue that promotive team voice and prohibitive team voice help teams achieve distinct collective outcomes-that is, team productivity performance gains and team safety performance gains, respectively. Further, we identify mechanisms through which promotive and prohibitive team voices uniquely influence team outcomes as well as boundary conditions for such influences. In data collected from 88 production teams, we found that promotive team voice had a positive association with team productivity performance gains. By contrast, prohibitive team voice had a positive association with team safety performance gains. The relationship between promotive team voice and team productivity performance gains was mediated by team innovation, and the relationship between prohibitive team voice and team safety performance gains was mediated by team monitoring. In addition, the indirect effect of prohibitive team voice on team safety performance gains via team monitoring was stronger when prior team safety performance was lower. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record},

However, LLM performance has not been compared to humans in both quality and the type of content produced. We examined this question by focusing on the skill of reframing negative situations to reduce negative emotions, also known as cognitive reappraisal. We trained both humans (N= 601) and GPT-4 to reframe negative vignettes (Nreappraisals = 4195) and compared their performance using human raters (N = 1744). GPT-4 outperformed humans on three of the four examined metrics. We investigated whether the gap was driven by effort or skill by incentivizing participants to produce better reappraisals, which led to increased time spent on reappraisals but did not decrease the gap between humans and GPT-4. Content analysis suggested that high-quality reappraisals produced by GPT-4 were associated with being more semantically similar to the emotional scenarios, which pointed to the fact that GPT-4's success is predicated on tuning into the specific scenario. Results were in the opposite direction for humans, whose reappraisals were rated higher when being more semantically different from the emotional scenario, suggesting that human success is predicated on generalizing away from the specific situations. These results help us understand the nature of emotional support by LLMs and how it compares to humans.},

  abstract = {This paper reports a study that examined two types of exploratory computer learning methods: self-discovery vs. co-discovery, the latter of which involves two users working together to learn a system. An experiment was conducted to compare these two methods and the results were interpreted within a mental model framework. Co-discovery subjects were better than self-discovery subjects at making inferences about the capability and extended functions of the system. Furthermore, while working by themselves after an initial period of learning, they performed better in a similar, though more complex task than the one they encountered at the learning phase. Process tracing analysis showed that self-discovery subjects focused more on surface structures, such as detailed physical actions, for implementing the task. On the other hand, co-discovery groups focused more on relating lower level actions to higher level goals. Therefore, co-discovery subjects had a better understanding of the relationships between the physical actions and goals, and hence formed mental models with higher inference potential than self-discovery subjects.

  abstract = {Peer review is a widely accepted mechanism for research evaluation, playing a pivotal role in academic publishing. However, criticisms have long been leveled at this mechanism, mostly because of its poor efficiency and low reproducibility. Recent years have seen the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting the peer review process. Nonetheless, with the involvement of humans, such limitations remain inevitable. In this paper, we propose the concept and pipeline of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) and review the relevant literature and technologies of achieving a full-scale computerized review process. On the basis of the review and discussion, we conclude that there is already corresponding research and preliminary implementation at each stage of ASPR. We further look into the challenges in ASPR with the existing technologies. The major difficulties lie in inadequate data, imperfect document parsing and representation, defective human\${\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}\$computer interaction, and flawed deep logical reasoning. Moreover, we point out the future directions and discuss the possible moral and ethical issues of ASPR. In the foreseeable future, ASPR and peer review will coexist in a reinforcing manner before ASPR is able to fully undertake the reviewing workload from humans.},

Clark) is a simple reminder that feedback can be helpful or not, assume a variety of forms, be provided at different times, and have diverse effects on different people. But what if there were a drought (no rain, no feedback)? Consider the following two questions: If a tree falls in the woods and nobody's around to hear it...does it make a noise? If a teacher instructs some content or skill and doesn't assess and support learning...can students deeply learn? In both cases, the answer is no. So feedback is really important...not just for learning new things, but pretty much across all of life. There are countless examples of feedback in nature...with both positive and negative functions. For example, our hypothalamus reacts to changes in temperature and responds appropriately. If the temperature drops, we shiver to bring up the temperature; and if it's too hot, we sweat to cool down via evaporation. Predator-prey relations in nature are also well-known examples of feedback loops, as is climate change. The key difference between positive and negative feedback is their response to change...positive feedback enlarges change while negative feedback reduces change"...},

  abstract = {This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub "prompt-based learning". Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y{\textbar}x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.

Our study investigates three key research questions: (1) the number of different prompt types that can jailbreak LLMs, (2) the effectiveness of jailbreak prompts in circumventing LLM constraints, and (3) the resilience of ChatGPT against these jailbreak prompts. Initially, we develop a classification model to analyze the distribution of existing prompts, identifying ten distinct patterns and three categories of jailbreak prompts. Subsequently, we assess the jailbreak capability of prompts with ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0, utilizing a dataset of 3,120 jailbreak questions across eight prohibited scenarios. Finally, we evaluate the resistance of ChatGPT against jailbreak prompts, finding that the prompts can consistently evade the restrictions in 40 use-case scenarios. The study underscores the importance of prompt structures in jailbreaking LLMs and discusses the challenges of robust jailbreak prompt generation and prevention.},

  abstract = {Most experiments in consciousness research assume that awareness is a dichotomous 'either/or' phenomenon. However, participants can distinguish multiple levels of subjective experience of simple features (colour, shape etc.), which correlate with their performance in different tasks. As experiments showing multiple levels of perceptual awareness question the widespread idea that many forms of perception can occur unconsciously, we investigated emotional priming combined with methods able to measure small variations in subjective experience. We show awareness of emotional faces is gradual rather than dichotomous, and that the effects of emotional priming are predicted by the level of perceptual awareness of emotional faces, with no effects when reported unseen. The results question how much unconscious perceptions can influence behaviour. As priming is one of the most well-established phenomena believed to occur unconsciously, the results expand the growing body of evidence that questions the contributions of unconscious processing on behaviour.},

An important process within this is shared assessment, which refers to student involvement in the assessment and learning practice, a process of dialogue and collaboration between teacher and students aimed at improving the learning process, both individually and collectively. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state of affairs in depth. This paper therefore highlights, on the one hand, the lessons learned through research and development in higher education (i.e. providing clear learning goals and feedback, guiding learning, involving students in learning and assessment, promoting feedback as a process of dialogue, and making processes viable). On the other hand, these lessons also suggest some challenges and difficulties that must be addressed in the future in order to further improve formative and shared assessment in higher education. These include the need for more research on its effects, further conceptual clarification, the intersubjectivity of the process, recognition of the divergent processes and ethical principles, students? involvement not only in assessment but also in determining academic grades, and broading learning goals and objetives in FA \& SA.},

In this paper, we present results on the first NLP experiments conducted on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers for datasets of size {$>$}= 100 sentences. Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke et al. (2010) with quantum theory, we create representations for sentences that have a natural mapping to quantum circuits. We use these representations to implement and successfully train two NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We describe in detail the main principles, the process and challenges of these experiments, in a way accessible to NLP researchers, thus paving the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing.},

This study focused on two questions, (a) How do leaders perceive the future of Jesuit higher education? and (b) What key factors identified by these leaders will lead to the most desirable outcome for Jesuit higher education in the next twenty years? Interviews were conducted with ten leaders from the Jesuit higher education community. The ten participants included presidents, provosts, high-ranking officials, and directors. Eight participants are employed in universities across the United States, and two participants are employed as administrators of Jesuit education. The methodology used in this study was Ethnographic Futures Research, an approach used to elicit participant perceptions of alternative futures from optimistic, pessimistic, and most probable future scenarios. This study aimed to present a strategic outline in the form of recommendations to guide leaders of Jesuit institutions through times of rapid and imminent change. Findings from this study include identification of common perceptions of factors that will influence change to the future of Jesuit higher education. Factors of change include leadership strategies, economic impact, technological advances, and evolving student demographics. Findings further revealed more specific driving forces of change, including faculty influence, societal influence, and Jesuit identity issues. A general discovery made by this study was the significant acceptance that change cannot be avoided and strategies must be implemented so as not to respond and react to these changes, but to engage in change with the confidence only attained through strategic and ongoing future studies that will aid in the sustainability of Jesuit higher education institutions in the United States.},

In an attempt to address this need, several studies have extended models of extrinsic motivation to include intrinsic variables. However, these studies largely downplay the role of users' intrinsic motivations in predicting system use and how this role differs from that of extrinsic motivation. Even though expectations are a firmly established consequence of motivations and an antecedent of interaction evaluations, this area remains understudied. This paper addresses these gaps by developing and testing a comprehensive model -- the multimotive information systems continuance model -- that explains more accurately and thoroughly the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, explains how the fulfillment of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affects systems-use outcome variables differently through met expectations, and accounts for the effects of key design constructs.},

Using data collected from 216 supervisor-subordinate dyads from various industries in Taiwan, we employ structural equation modeling analysis to test our hypotheses. The results show that expectancy value mediates the relationship between supervisor expert power and subordinates' NFSB. Moreover, self-presentation cost mediates the relationship between reflected appraisals of supervisors' and subordinates' NFSB. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Like humans, large language models (LLMs) do not always generate the best output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by {\textasciitilde}20\% absolute on average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test time using our simple, standalone approach.  Code, data, and demo at https://selfrefine.info/},

  abstract = {This qualitative study responds to ongoing discussions in creative writing studies about the lack of discipline-specific pedagogic training for graduate creative writing students. Since 1994, creative writing scholars have called for graduate programs to offer instruction in creative writing pedagogy in order to correct persistent misconceptions of creative writing as unteachable, prepare graduate students to teach undergraduate courses, and to suggest alternatives to the entrenched pedagogic practice of the traditional writers workshop. Currently, 33 U.S. graduate programs offer creative writing pedagogy courses, but these courses have gone virtually unexamined in the literature. Through phenomenographic interviews with seven creative writing pedagogy teachers at six U.S. graduate creative writing programs and an analysis of their course syllabi, this dissertation project investigated how instructors of those few courses offered in creative writing pedagogy prepare future instructors. This study discovered significant variation in creative writing pedagogy course parameters and in creative writing pedagogy teachers conceptions of teaching described in terms of five categories of pedagogic identity. This study suggests that creative writing pedagogy courses are unlikely to change conceptions or lead to innovation in pedagogic practice unless they address core conceptions of teachers and teaching and investigate alternative pedagogies. Guiding objectives for creative writing pedagogy courses drawn from all five pedagogic identities are identified. These objectives and the categories of pedagogic identity discovered in the data are intended to provide creative writing and creative writing pedagogy teachers, program administrators, and scholars with tools useful for reflection, evaluation, and planning for the future education of creative writing teachers.},

Those who believe intelligence is a fixed entity (entity theorists) tend to emphasize 'performance goals,' leaving them vulnerable to negative feedback and likely to disengage from challenging learning opportunities. In contrast, students who believe intelligence is malleable (incremental theorists) tend to emphasize 'learning goals' and rebound better from occasional failures. Guided by cognitive neuroscience models of top-down, goal-directed behavior, we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to understand how these beliefs influence attention to information associated with successful error correction. Focusing on waveforms associated with conflict detection and error correction in a test of general knowledge, we found evidence indicating that entity theorists oriented differently toward negative performance feedback, as indicated by an enhanced anterior frontal P3 that was also positively correlated with concerns about proving ability relative to others. Yet, following negative feedback, entity theorists demonstrated less sustained memory-related activity (left temporal negativity) to corrective information, suggesting reduced effortful conceptual encoding of this material-a strategic approach that may have contributed to their reduced error correction on a subsequent surprise retest. These results suggest that beliefs can influence learning success through top-down biasing of attention and conceptual processing toward goal-congruent information.},

This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.},

  abstract = {This book takes a historical approach to explore data, algorithms, their use in practice through applications of AI in various settings, and all of the surrounding ethical and DEI implications. Summarizing our current knowledge and highlighting gaps, it offers original examples from empirical research in various settings, such as healthcare, social media, and the GIG economy. The author investigates how systems relying on a binary structure (machines) work in systems that are instead analogic (societies). Further, he examines how underrepresented populations, who have been historically penalized by technologies, can play an active role in the design of automated systems, with a specific focus on the US legal and social system. One issue is that main tasks of machines concern classification, which, while efficient for speeding up decision-making processes, are inherently biased. Ultimately, this work advocates for ethical design and responsible implementation and deployment of technology in organizations and society through through government-sponsored social justice, in contrast with free market policies. This interdisciplinary text contributes to the timely and relevant debate on algorithmic fairness, biases, and potential discriminations. It will appeal to researchers in business ethics and information systems while building on theories from anthropology, psychology, sociology, management, marketing, and economics. Marco Marabelli is a Professor of Computer Information Systems at Bentley University, USA. His research focuses on the ethical and DEI implications of the use of emerging technologies in organizations and society and on the historical and legal aspects concerning social injustice associated with the use of artificial intelligence},

  abstract = {This paper reports an empirical study intended to provide detailed comparisons amongst and between the varieties of available measures of computer self-efficacy (CSE). Our purpose is to ascertain their relative abilities to isolate the CSE construct from other related constructs and to capture variance in performance attributed to changes in CSE level. In addition, we investigate the importance of ensuring the measure being used is sufficiently aligned with the task domain of interest. Finally, we explore the stability of CSE measures as they relate to the current state of evolution within the computing domain. Marakas, Yi, and Johnson (1998) proposed a framework for the construction of instruments intended to measure the CSE construct that we have adopted as a basis for this series of investigations. To that end, we advance and test a set of hypotheses derived from the Marakas et al. (1998) framework. Results of the analyses support the need for adherence to the tenets of the proposed framework as well as provide evidence that CSE measures suffer from degradation of their explanatory power over time. Further, this study brings forth the importance of appropriately validating measures of CSE using approaches intended for a formative rather than a reflective construct. These results suggest that the common practices of instrument validation and reuse of long-standing instruments to measure CSE may not be the most effective approach to the study of the construct. Implications for future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Research in IT must address the design tasks faced by practitioners. Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.},

Authors of the present study argue that the results of these studies did not conclusively support the hierarchical model and that the model did not accurately reflect the tenets of cognitive evaluation theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1985) from which the IMI is drawn. It is also argued that a measure of perceived locus of causality is required to model intrinsic motivation properly. The development of a perceived locus of causality for exercise scale is described, and alternative models, in which perceived competence and perceived locus of causality are held to have causal influences on intrinsic motivation, are compared with an oblique confirmatory factor analytic model in which the constructs are held at the same conceptual level. Structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model in which perceived locus of causality mediates the effects of perceived competence on pressure-tension, interest-enjoyment, and effort-importance. It is argued that conceptual and operational problems with the IMI, as currently used, should be addressed before it becomes established as the instrument of choice for assessing levels of intrinsic motivation.},

Organizational change management approaches are also generally not effective on their own, because they take as a given the IT ``solutions'' developed by a technical team. Consequently, the potential for the IT ``solution'' to be misaligned with important organizational characteristics, such as culture or incentives, is great.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND  Within the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, all authors develop their own distinctive writing styles. Whether the relative occurrence of common words can be measured to produce accurate models of authorship is of particular interest. This work introduces a new score that helps to highlight such variations in word occurrence, and is applied to produce models of authorship of a large group of plays from the Shakespearean era.  METHODOLOGY  A text corpus containing 55,055 unique words was generated from 168 plays from the Shakespearean era (16th and 17th centuries) of undisputed authorship. A new score, CM1, is introduced to measure variation patterns based on the frequency of occurrence of each word for the authors John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton and William Shakespeare, compared to the rest of the authors in the study (which provides a reference of relative word usage at that time). A total of 50 WEKA methods were applied for Fletcher, Jonson and Middleton, to identify those which were able to produce models yielding over 90\% classification accuracy. This ensemble of WEKA methods was then applied to model Shakespearean authorship across all 168 plays, yielding a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) performance of over 90\%. Furthermore, the best model yielded an MCC of 99\%.  CONCLUSIONS  Our results suggest that different authors, while adhering to the structural and grammatical bounds of a common language, develop measurably distinct styles by the tendency to over-utilise or avoid particular common words and phrasings. Considering language and the potential of words as an abstract chaotic system with a high entropy, similarities can be drawn to the Maxwell's Demon thought experiment; authors subconsciously favour or filter certain words, modifying the probability profile in ways that could reflect their individuality and style.},

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no "gold standard" measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.},

  abstract = {There is a near overflow of presentation slides on digital platforms, such as SlideShare.net, with 40 million. This presents a challenge in assessing their projected impact due to its high complexity and required expertise. We propose a novel approach using machine learning techniques to predict presentation slide audience reach. We crawled a unique dataset of over 8000 slides and extracted relevant attributes. A model was trained where we are the first to employ both numerical and textual inputs. Initial results with an R{$^2$} value of 0.579 suggest that the audience reach of presentation slides can be automatically evaluated. Our findings contribute to the current understanding of the assessment of online documents, introducing possibilities for further research, such as focusing on domain-specific applications and incorporating them as tools for decision support in content management systems on sharing platforms.},

The study is concerned with an ongoing design science research project  that focuses on constructing a nascent design theory for a novel AI-based slide  evaluation support system (SESS) that aims to assist users, particularly educators,  create high-quality presentation slides. The proposed concept leverages recent  developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) to analyze multi modal user-generated content. Drawing on signaling theory, user-generated  online reviews, and expert interviews, this research aims to contribute to deline ating the capabilities of artificial intelligence in digital content evaluation, spe cifically in assisting users to improve the quality of their presentation slides.

  abstract = {Abstract               This study examined how and when a chatbot's emotional support was effective in reducing people's stress and worry. It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment, participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none, or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants, and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner's reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However, when emotional support was absent, a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants' stress.                                         Lay Summary               In recent years, AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people's worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences, they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual. Interestingly, if a chatbot only reciprocally self-disclosed but offered no emotional support, the outcome was worse than if the chatbot did not respond to people at all. This work will help in the development of supportive chatbots by providing insights into when and what they should self-disclose.},

Another 18 experts grouped BCTs according to similarity of active ingredients in an open-sort task. Inter-rater agreement amongst six researchers coding 85 intervention descriptions by BCTs was assessed.This resulted in 93 BCTs clustered into 16 groups. Of the 26 BCTs occurring at least five times, 23 had adjusted kappas of 0.60 or above.``BCT taxonomy v1,'' an extensive taxonomy of 93 consensually agreed, distinct BCTs, offers a step change as a method for specifying interventions, but we anticipate further development and evaluation based on international, interdisciplinary consensus.},

In this article, the authors describe their experience using Dee Fink's taxonomy and course design model to create what they believe are now significant learning experiences for students in their introductory and intermediate economics courses. They describe the changes they made and then discuss what they have found to be positive assessment results from the courses. (Contains 1 table.)},

  abstract = {Peer assessment (PA) is the process of students grading and giving feedback to each other's work. Learning analytics is a field focused on analysing educational data to understand and improve learning processes. Using learning analytics on PA data has the potential to gain new insights into the feedback giving/receiving process. This exploratory study focuses on backward evaluation, an under researched aspect of peer assessment, where students react to the feedback that they received on their work. Two aspects are analysed: 1) backward evaluation characteristics depending on student perception of feedback that they receive on their work, and 2) the relationship between rubric characteristics and backward evaluation. A big dataset (N=7,660 records) from an online platform called Peergrade was analysed using both statistical methods and Epistemic Network Analysis. Students who found feedback useful tended to be more accepting by acknowledging their errors, intending to revise their text, and praising its usefulness, while students who found the feedback less useful tended to be more defensive by expressing that they were confused about its meaning, critical towards its form and focus, and in disagreement with the claims. Moreover, students mostly suggested feedback improvement in terms of feedback specificity, justification and constructivity, rather than kindness. The paper concludes by discussing the potential and limitations of using LA methods to analyse big PA datasets.},

  abstract = {Intimacy is an important component of romantic relationships and a lack of intimacy is one of the most common presenting problems of distressed couples, but the process through which intimacy develops is not well understood.  This study examined the evidence for the interpersonal process model of intimacy described by Reis and Shaver (1988), which proposes that self-disclosure and empathic responding are the basis of intimate interactions.  The sample consisted of 108 community couples who completed measures of intimacy after having videotaped discussions about relationship injuries that occurred both within and outside of the relationship.  The Couples' Intimate Behavior Coding System (CIB) was developed to assess depth of factual, emotional, and cognitive self-disclosure and components of empathic responding in these discussions.  Results indicate that males' own disclosure and empathic responding predicted their feelings of intimacy, whereas females' intimacy was predicted by their partner's disclosure and empathic responding.   The effects of both self- and partner-disclosure appear to have been driven by factual and emotional components of disclosure.  These results provide preliminary evidence that self-disclosure and empathic responding are important behaviors in the development of intimate feelings for both men and women, but the manner in which these behaviors influence intimacy differs by gender.},

  abstract = {The increasing fluency and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of corresponding tools aiding detection of LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM's probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

  abstract = {The ability to prepare sizeable multi-qubit entangled states with full qubit control is a critical milestone for physical platforms upon which quantum computers are built. We investigate the extent to which entanglement is found within a prepared graph state on the 20-qubit superconducting quantum computer IBM Q Poughkeepsie. We prepared a graph state along a path consisting of all twenty qubits within the device and performed full quantum state tomography on all groups of four connected qubits along this path. We determined that each pair of connected qubits was inseparable and hence the prepared state was entangled. Additionally, a genuine multipartite entanglement witness was measured on all qubit subpaths of the graph state and we found genuine multipartite entanglement on chains of up to three qubits. These results represent a demonstration of entanglement in one of the largest solid-state qubit arrays to date and indicate the positive direction of progress towards the goal of implementing complex quantum algorithms relying on such effects.},

The motivation construct of computer-self efficacy plays an integral role in learning with CBLEs. This literature review synthesizes research that has empirically examined factors related to computer self-efficacy and the relationship between computer self-efficacy, learning outcomes, and learning processes with CBLEs. Results indicate that behavioral and psychological factors are positively related to computer self-efficacy. Students who receive behavioral modeling report significantly higher computer self-efficacy than do students who receive the more traditional instruction-based method when learning with CBLEs. Computer self-efficacy is related both to learning outcomes and to learning processes with CBLEs. This review also offers theoretical and methodological issues for future research in the area of computer self-efficacy.},

One important challenge in this context is the users' lack of process knowledge. Employees' process knowledge is a necessary prerequisite for proper process execution and a critical factor for achieving successful process standardization, improvement, and ultimately process performance. Therefore, it is key for organizations to support their employees with the proper process knowledge. In order to address this challenge, we propose the concept of process guidance and design process guidance systems to increase users' process knowledge and their process execution performance. We argue that users require (1) general information on the process, such as an overview of all the steps and their sequence, (2) specific information on how to execute the steps to navigate through the process, and (3) the possibility to identify their current position within the process. When reflecting our DSR project, we identified three major key learnings. First, it was important to have identified multiple literature streams for the grounding of our design. Second, involving in a real-world case and engaging with our case company helped us to improve the relevance as well as the contribution of our research. Third, another important lesson learned is that researchers applying the DSR approach should be engaged with the DSR community, in particular the International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology (DESRIST) conference.},

This article addresses the question of how the shift to a qualitative, phenomenological approach has impinged on research and evaluation in distance education. Three issues that influence the style and approach of such research are identified: (1) the role and influence of educational technology with the assumptions which it embodies about the course design process and the relationship between research and practice; (2) the nature of the organization and the structures within which research and evaluation are conducted; and (3) the individual staff involved, their backgrounds, and their interests. The discussion then focuses on the role and influence of educational technology; qualitative-illuminative studies of learning and phenomenological approaches to research and evaluation; critical theory and action research; international perspectives in research on distance education; and developing programs for research and theory. It is concluded that, although the "silent revolution" identified by Fetterman has not really occurred in distance education, important initiatives are in progress with the development and elaboration of the "new educational technology." Lists of 33 references and 35 Student Research Center Reports are included. (ALF)},

This study sought to understand who the instructional designers in higher education are, and how they came to their roles in their institutions. An understanding of these instructional designers in higher education could lead to improved teaching and learning experiences for students in higher education. Five themes emerged from the cases studied: flexibility; moral purpose; relationship building; time and project management; and ongoing professional development. Instructional designers do more than design instructional experiences. They are informal leaders who have an immediate and profound effect on the future of higher education. Their role in distance education is redefining how we educate students, and is shaping distance education and, ultimately, the face of the institutions in which they work.},

Drawing on the appraisal tendency framework, we expect that negative performance feedback increases sadness, which then spills over to negatively affect performance on a future task. In addition, we expect two individual traits---feedback self-efficacy and grit---to moderate the relationship, such that the negative effect of sadness on subsequent task performance is weakened for individuals with high feedback self-efficacy and high grit. We use face-based emotion recognition software to capture emotion expression during the delivery of positive and negative feedback. We find support for our mediated moderation model in a sample of 96 participants. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

  abstract = {Quantum simulations of electronic structure with a transformed Hamiltonian that includes some electron correlation effects are demonstrated. The transcorrelated Hamiltonian used in this work is efficiently constructed classically, at polynomial cost, by an approximate similarity transformation with an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator. This Hamiltonian is Hermitian, includes no more than two-particle interactions, and is free of electron-electron singularities. We investigate the effect of such a transformed Hamiltonian on the accuracy and computational cost of quantum simulations by focusing on a widely used solver for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, namely the variational quantum eigensolver method, based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) Ansatz. Nevertheless, the formalism presented here translates straightforwardly to other quantum algorithms for chemistry. Our results demonstrate that a transcorrelated Hamiltonian, paired with extremely compact bases, produces explicitly correlated energies comparable to those from much larger bases. For the chemical species studied here, explicitly correlated energies based on an underlying 6-31G basis had cc-pVTZ quality. The use of the very compact transcorrelated Hamiltonian reduces the number of CNOT gates required to achieve cc-pVTZ quality by up to two orders of magnitude, and the number of qubits by a factor of three.},

The rapid growth and expansion of online learning now accounts for over 33\% of all higher education course offerings. College leaders recognize the need to improve retention rates and maintain or improve online course quality. Industries other then education routinely use usability testing and research to inform the design and revision process. Research isolating usability to identify its effects is necessary to support and define implementation to inform course design process and online programs. This study collected usability and perception data during the Spring 2015 semester at a community college in the Northeast. Students completed five common online tasks in one of two simulated courses, one that met usability standards and one that did not. Responses from the course designed to meet identified usability standards were significantly higher for usability ratings, ease-of-use, satisfaction, motivation and Teacher Presence items (from Community of Inquiry theory). A comparison of student versus faculty perspectives was also part of the study's findings. The study's findings conclude that usability testing should be used to provide a model for improved online course design, to support the inclusion or priority of usability in professional development as well as support for implementing usability standards in online course evaluation systems such as Quality MattersTM.

Institutions often utilize online education as a method to serve more students while lowering instructional costs. While online education may be more cost effective in some situations, college decision makers need to consider the full range of cost implications associated with these online offerings. The unbundling of faculty roles in online distance education programs is one cost consideration which is often overlooked. As the faculty role has become more distributed, so have the costs associated with providing instruction and instructional support. This paper reviews the hidden costs associated with the unbundling of the faculty role and presents a framework for calculating the true costs of the unbundled faculty role. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Drawing on a diversified literature associated with experiential learning, emotion research, and social cognitive theories of change, the nature of self-development is explored. It is argued that underpinning effective self-development is the integrated operation of three metaskills?skills that are required for the development of other skills?relating to one?s ability to manage emotional reactions to feedback, to carry out effectively the practice of self-reflection, and to enact self-regulatory processes for development. The SDLD framework extends formal organization-based leadership-development practices and integrates multiple processes to aid leaders and human resource development (HRD) practitioners in the promotion and enactment of leadership self-development. The framework also provides guidance for HRD research on self-development and a number of research implications are presented.},

  abstract = {While writing peer reviews resembles an important task in science, education, and large organizations, providing fruitful suggestions to peers is not a straightforward task, as different user interaction designs of text suggestion interfaces can have diverse effects on user behaviors when writing the review text. Generative language models might be able to support humans in formulating reviews with textual suggestions. Previous systems use two designs for providing text suggestions, but do not empirically evaluate them: inline and list of suggestions. To investigate the effects of embedding NLP text generation models in the two designs, we collected user requirements to implement Hamta as an example of assistants providing reviewers with text suggestions. Our experiment on comparing the two designs on 31 participants indicates that people using the inline interface provided longer reviews on average, while participants using the list of suggestions experienced more ease of use in using our tool. The results shed light on important design findings for embedding text generation models in user-centered assistants.},

  abstract = {Organizational change in today's competitive landscape is no longer just an option, but a fundamental strategy for success. In order to be the premier player in this type of competitive landscape, customer focus has to become a priority, and bearing this in mind both academia and competitive organizations have one key objective in common. Their current focus is on implementing successful support systems in order to meet their end-users' needs. As early as 1995, University College Cork (a Third-level Irish university) introduced on-line support to provide learning material for students ranging from full/part-time undergraduates and postgraduates to distance-learners. However, students identified a need for more support, the type that only a more interactive system can provide. This paper focuses on the evolution of e-learning and learning management systems (LMS) in considering e-learning as the academic equivalent to the customer relationship management (CRM) challenge. This research outlines the different characteristics necessary for the successful management of the learning process and the support needed by students, through the investigation of current research and the analysis of the case environment.},

  abstract = {This study extends multisource feedback research by assessing the effects of rater source and raters' cultural value orientations on rating bias (leniency and halo). Using a motivational perspective of performance appraisal, the authors posit that subordinate raters followed by peers will exhibit more rating bias than superiors. More important, given that multisource feedback systems were premised on low power distance and individualistic cultural assumptions, the authors expect raters' power distance and individualism-collectivism orientations to moderate the effects of rater source on rating bias. Hierarchical linear modeling on data collected from 1,447 superiors, peers, and subordinates who provided developmental feedback to 172 military officers show that (a) subordinates exhibit the most rating leniency, followed by peers and superiors; (b) subordinates demonstrate more halo than superiors and peers, whereas superiors and peers do not differ; (c) the effects of power distance on leniency and halo are strongest for subordinates than for peers and superiors; (d) the effects of collectivism on leniency were stronger for subordinates and peers than for superiors; effects on halo were stronger for subordinates than superiors, but these effects did not differ for subordinates and peers. The present findings highlight the role of raters' cultural values in multisource feedback ratings.},

This reformulation is used to identify seven principles of good feedback practice that support self?regulation. A key argument is that students are already assessing their own work and generating their own feedback, and that higher education should build on this ability. The research underpinning each feedback principle is presented, and some examples of easy?to?implement feedback strategies are briefly described. This shift in focus, whereby students are seen as having a proactive rather than a reactive role in generating and using feedback, has profound implications for the way in which teachers organise assessments and support learning.},

  abstract = {Since Instructional Design (ID) has been an established discipline in European countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium or the United Kingdom for more than 20 years, it seems only natural that it is getting more and more important in the German-speaking countries as well. In order to produce efficient learning environments for multimedia learning, systematic planning is necessary. At this point, Instructional Design - based on the ideas Robert M. Gagn{\'e} developed more than fifty years ago - seems to offer interesting solutions. The process of designing and developing such environments includes strategic decisions concerning the technical base or the overall pedagogical orientation and ending in the choice between fonts and colours. ID is also concerned with methods and tools to support design activities, organizational aspects, the competencies and attitudes of the designers, variables of the context, problems of the dissemination and implementation of new educational procedures as well as the questions raised by the efforts to evaluate different aspects of e-learning in all its variants. The contributions to the 5th International Workshop of the SIG 6 "Instructional Design" of the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction (EARLI) in Erfurt in 2002 compiled in this volume try to offer some solutions and raise new questions. A lot more empirical research remains to be done and there is still a lack of new theoretical models. This research gap offers a chance to new colleagues, especially from countries not yet represented in the scientific community of ID, to contribute their ideas},

Building on a rich tradition of constructing and evaluating artifacts, recent design science research has made significant advances toward better understanding the explanatory aspect of design theory. Researchers have stressed the importance of mid-range theories that relate IT artifact features (causes) with measures and goals (effects). Against this background, design theorizing reveals certain commonalities with theorizing in the behavioral science field. In this paper, we explore differences and similarities between theorizing in these areas. We develop a framework that allows for a better understanding of the relationships between manifest design decisions, kernel theory constructs and their evaluation metrics. We identify common issues that arise from conceptual distances between these ideas and show their potential impact on both the design and evaluation of artifacts. The field of electronic feedback systems is used as an illustrative example.},

  abstract = {Recent media revelations have demonstrated the extent of third-party tracking and monitoring online, much of it spurred by data aggregation, profiling, and selective targeting. How to protect privacy online is a frequent question in public discourse and has reignited the interest of government actors. In the United States, notice-and-consent remains the fallback approach in online privacy policies, despite its weaknesses. This essay presents an alternative approach, rooted in the theory of contextual integrity. Proposals to improve and fortify notice-and-consent, such as clearer privacy policies and fairer information practices, will not overcome a fundamental flaw in the model, namely, its assumption that individuals can understand all facts relevant to true choice at the moment of pair-wise contracting between individuals and data gatherers. Instead, we must articulate a backdrop of context-specific substantive norms that constrain what information websites can collect, with whom they can share it, and under what conditions it can be shared. In developing this approach, the paper warns that the current bias in conceiving of the Net as a predominantly commercial enterprise seriously limits the privacy agenda.},

  abstract = {The success of a distance education institution depends greatly on the effectiveness of its media system. Distance learning courses are normally designed in the form of integrated multi-media packages. To design an effective distance learning course, careful selection of media must be taken into account. This is because it is believed that the right choice of medium for instruction, together with careful integration of components in multi-media learning packages can enhance students' learning skills.The main concern addressed in this study is the criteria used in the selection, design, and use of media in distance learning courses in the Open University of the United Kingdom (OU) and Sukothai Thammathirat Open University, Thailand (STOU). The study observes two different kinds of integration employed in course design process at OU and STOU. Attitudes of media producers and students in both universities towards the design of broadcast materials as integral parts of multi-media packages are examined.The study describes how multi-media integration affects ways in which students learn, and develop their skills in learning. It goes on to suggest that higher-order learning skills cannot be taught and learned as part of a regular curriculum, but they can be developed through the use of well-designed integrated multi-media packages. Two selected courses from OU and STOU are analyzed in this respect.},

Attempts to improve feedback frequently focus on faculty development programs without addressing learners' capabilities to engage with feedback. For feedback to be effective, students need to understand its processes and to translate this into practice. Developing student feedback literacy may enhance feedback engagement and, therefore, learning outcomes. This qualitative interview study aimed to problematise student feedback literacy in the healthcare setting, from the learner's perspective. Before commencing placements, 105 healthcare students at an Australian teaching hospital participated in a feedback literacy program. After their placements, 27 students engaged in semi-structured interviews to explore their feedback experiences. Informed by workplace learning theory, interview transcripts were analysed using the framework method of qualitative analysis. Students reported reframing feedback as a process they could initiate and engage in, rather one they were subjected to. When they took an intentional stance, students noted that feedback conversations generated plans for improvement which they were enacting. However, students had to work hard against orthodox feedback expectations and habits in healthcare. They privileged intraprofessional supervisor feedback over interprofessional practitioners, patients, or peers. Findings suggest that student engagement with feedback can be augmented with focussed retraining. However, further research examining the structural and cultural influences on students' capacity to be active in workplace feedback is warranted.},

  abstract = {Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27\% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90\% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.  21 pages, 7 figures},

This paper draws on previous research identifying the ways of knowing of undergraduates on entry to a UK post-92 university, findings from which confirm the prevalence of absolute beliefs in which knowledge is viewed as certain, uncontested and students are largely authority-dependent. Student perspectives on assessment and feedback are explored based on thematic analysis of student responses within two main categories of beliefs, absolute/dualist versus contextual/pluralist. The paper teases out the implications of these perspectives for students' satisfaction with their assessment and feedback experience in the context of today's increasingly market-orientated higher education environment. Findings demonstrate that student perspectives on, and satisfaction with, assessment and feedback are strongly intertwined with their beliefs on knowledge and teaching. Students holding absolute/dualist beliefs considered `good' assessment and feedback practice to entail clear and unambiguous assessment tasks, criteria and standards along with the receipt of unequivocal and corrective feedback. The paper concludes that faced with assessment tasks that move beyond established facts and demonstrable theories it may only be students who view knowledge as relative and mutable that will likely be satisfied with their assessment and feedback experience.},

A structural equation modeling with 300 cases of young Koreans yielded the following results. First, the social presence young users experienced in the metaverse platform significantly predicted the amount of supportive interactions they engaged in the metaverse. Second, the amount of supportive interactions in the metaverse positively predicted users' perception of social self-efficacy. Finally, social self-efficacy mediated the relationship between the amount of supportive interactions in the metaverse and young people's feelings of loneliness. The findings of this study provide implications on how to design features and services in the metaverse to maximize its social benefits to young users.},

Despite its fairly widespread use, little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in adult samples. In the present study, factor structure of the ACS and its relationship with symptoms of anxiety and depression was investigated in a total sample of 728 Icelandic university students. Exploratory factor analysis in sample 1 (n=361), yielded two factors, labeled focusing and shifting. Confirmatory factor analysis in sample 2 (n=367) showed a reasonable fit of this two factor model. The two factors correlated strongly (0.73). The two subscales showed different predictive validity in a set of hierarchical regression analyses where the focusing subscale made a significant prediction of anxiety scores when depression scores were controlled for, and the shifting subscale significant prediction of depression scores when anxiety scores were controlled for. These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies on attentional and executive control in anxiety and depression.},

A Disclosure Decision model is introduced that specifies a cognitive process resulting in decisions that affect the content, depth, breadth, and duration of self-disclosure. One of 5 possible disclosure goals must be made accessible. Disclosure must be selected as a strategy for reaching that goal, and a disclosure target must be selected. Potential disclosers then evaluate the subjective utility and the subjective risk of disclosing. The subjective utility of disclosing is hypothesized to decrease breadth and increase duration of disclosure. Subjective risk is hypothesized to decrease depth of disclosure. The Disclosure Decision model is designed to provide a framework for studying and predicting self-disclosure across situations.},

However, it is challenging for requirements engineers to continuously elicit needs for systems used by heterogeneous end-users who are out of organisational reach. Objective: We aim at supporting continuous requirements elicitation by combining user feedback and usage monitoring. Online feedback mechanisms enable end-users to remotely communicate problems, experiences, and opinions, while monitoring provides valuable information about runtime events. It is argued that bringing both information sources together can help requirements engineers to understand end-user needs better. Method/Tool: We present FAME, a framework for the combined and simultaneous collection of feedback and monitoring data in web and mobile contexts to support continuous requirements elicitation. In addition to a detailed discussion of our technical solution, we present the first evidence that FAME can be successfully introduced in real-world contexts. Therefore, we deployed FAME in a web application of a German  small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) to collect user feedback and usage data. Results/Conclusion: Our results suggest that FAME not only can be successfully used in industrial environments but that bringing feedback and monitoring data together helps the SME to improve their understanding of end-user needs, ultimately supporting continuous requirements elicitation.},

  abstract = {Self-disclosures on online social networks have received increased attention in the last two decades. Researchers from different disciplines investigated manifold influencing variables, and studies applied different theories to explain why many users share very sensitive and personal information despite potential risks and negative consequences, whereas others do not. Oftentimes, it is argued that self-disclosure decisions result from a kind of rational ``calculus'' of risks and benefits. However, such an assumption of rationality can and has been criticized. Nevertheless, fundamental cognitive and affective mechanisms that underlie self-disclosure decision making on social networks are still under-explored. By building upon previous self-disclosure theories and models, dual-and tripartite-system perspectives of decision making, and former empirical findings, we propose a Tripartite Self-Disclosure Decision (TSDD) model that conceptualizes inner processes of online self-disclosure decision making. Central to this model is the proposed interaction of three neural and cognitive/affective systems: a reflective, an impulsive, and an interoceptive system. We further highlight individual and environmental features, which can impact individuals' online self-disclosure decisions by (interactively) influencing the proposed inner decision-making processes targeting the aforementioned three systems. Possible short- and long-term consequences are also discussed, which in turn can affect certain model components in subsequent self-disclosure decision situations. By taking such a neurocognitive perspective, we expand current research and models, which helps to better understand potentially risky information sharing on online social networks and can support attempts to prevent users from incautious self-disclosures.},

It is the place where faculty describe what content they will cover, what books and articles their students will read, the assignments they will complete, dates when things are due, and all the policies and rules that are supposed to keep everyone happy and out of trouble. The authors argue that the syllabus' primary function should be as a learning tool, one that is carefully crafted through a systematic course design process. The results of this study suggest that not only does the syllabus matter, the type of syllabus matters. When students read a learning-focused syllabus, they have significantly more positive perceptions of the document itself, the course described by the syllabus, and the instructor associated with the course.},

Considering the calls for IS research to develop a cumulative tradition, we hope more review articles will be published in the future and encourage researchers who start a review to use our typology to position their contribution.},

Research on human resource management has found that a key practice is employee involvement: enabling employees to make decisions on their own work and to contribute to organisational decision-making. A high degree of employee involvement creates work environments that are highly motivational and that emphasise skill development. And this is the type of work environment that organisations need to meet the demands for innovation and adaptability to technological change in a knowledge-driven economy. This policy brief examines the empirical evidence that workplaces where employee involvement is high are more successful in developing the capacity for high performance in workers than workplaces with lower levels of involvement. It examines the influence of work organisation on two factors contributing to performance: work engagement and skill development.},

In this work, we present a circuit-based flip-flop quantum random access memory to construct a quantum database of classical information in a systematic and flexible way. For registering or updating classical data consisting of M entries, each represented by n bits, the method requires O(n) qubits and O(Mn) steps. With post-selection at an additional cost, our method can also store continuous data as probability amplitudes. As an example, we present a procedure to convert classical training data for a quantum supervised learning algorithm to a quantum state. Further improvements can be achieved by reducing the number of state preparation queries with the introduction of quantum forking.},

Eighty participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the four groups: specific and frequent feedback, global and frequent feedback, specific and infrequent feedback, and global and infrequent feedback. A 2~?~2 factorial design was adopted. Participants were asked to work on a simulated order-fulfilling task and attended 24 sessions. The dependent variable was the error rate of the completed tasks. The results showed that more frequent feedback was more effective and specific feedback was more effective than global feedback in improving the quality of performance. Furthermore, an interactive effect between feedback frequency and specificity was found. Specific feedback was more effective than global feedback when the feedback was infrequent, but global feedback was comparable to specific feedback when it was frequent.},

  abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

Coaching providers have been quick to operationalise these generative language tools to create new products like AIMY, evoach and Vici. This paper examines the potential of AI chatbots and their integration into coaching tools. It will review the advantages and current limitations of AI coaching chatbots and offer a preliminary definition for the field, seeking to differentiate chatbots from human coaching.

  abstract = {Although feedback is often seen as a critical component of the learning process, many open questions about how specific feedback features contribute to the effectiveness of feedback remain---especially in regards to peer feedback of writing. Nelson and Schunn (2009) identified several important features of peer feedback in their nature of feedback model. In the current study, we test an updated theoretical model that includes a broader set of features and considers not only students' likelihood of implementing a comment but also the quality of their revisions. To empirically test the updated theoretical model, we analyze over 7,500 comments from 351 reviewers to 189 authors. Each comment was coded for the presence of praise, a problem description, a suggested solution, localization, focus (i.e., low prose, high prose, substance), implementation, and revision quality. To account for the cross-classified nesting of data, we used a 2-level, cross-classified, hierarchical logistic regression model. Only 2 feedback features increased students' likelihood of implementation (i.e., overall praise and localization), while several feedback features reduced students' likelihood of implementation (i.e., mitigating praise, solutions, and high-prose comments). Overlapping feedback features affected students' ability to revise and in opposing directions from their effect on likelihood of implementation: Revisions were less likely to improve the quality of their paper when implementing comments that included a specific location in the text, but they were more likely to improve the quality of their paper when implementing comments that focused on high-prose and substance issues. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen an impressive wave of advances recently, with models now excelling in a variety of tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and program synthesis. However, their potential to effectively use tools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for today's state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, largely due to their inability to generate accurate input arguments and their tendency to hallucinate the wrong usage of an API call. We release Gorilla, a finetuned LLaMA-based model that surpasses the performance of GPT-4 on writing API calls. When combined with a document retriever, Gorilla demonstrates a strong capability to adapt to test-time document changes, enabling flexible user updates or version changes. It also substantially mitigates the issue of hallucination, commonly encountered when prompting LLMs directly. To evaluate the model's ability, we introduce APIBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of HuggingFace, TorchHub, and TensorHub APIs. The successful integration of the retrieval system with Gorilla demonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more accurately, keep up with frequently updated documentation, and consequently increase the reliability and applicability of their outputs.

However, these intermediate inference steps may be inappropriate deductions from the initial context and lead to incorrect final predictions. Here we introduce REFINER, a framework for finetuning LMs to explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps while interacting with a critic model that provides automated feedback on the reasoning. Specifically, the critic provides structured feedback that the reasoning LM uses to iteratively improve its intermediate arguments. Empirical evaluations of REFINER on three diverse reasoning tasks show significant improvements over baseline LMs of comparable scale. Furthermore, when using GPT-3.5 or ChatGPT as the reasoner, the trained critic significantly improves reasoning without finetuning the reasoner. Finally, our critic model is trained without expensive human-in-the-loop data but can be substituted with humans at inference time.},

As a scientific community, we are doing ourselves a great disservice by ignoring the insights, artifacts, discoveries, and conversations that naturally occur in the scientific process of advancing knowledge that do not fit into the narrowly defined form of print-style papers. By failing to recognize, reward, and publish the wide variety of scholarly contributions that do not suit print-style papers, we hinder scientific progress, devalue important and necessary contributions to science, and demotivate these types of vital contributions. Although over three centuries of scientific publishing has demonstrated the effectiveness of the print medium for conveying scholarly knowledge, the print-style paper captures only a single form of scholarly contribution in a highly limited media format. Unfortunately, the current tenure and promotion process recognizes only this one form of scientific contribution. As a result, science at large advances inevitably only by this single type of contribution. Given the radical advances in audiovisual technologies, storage and bandwidth capacities, public virtual infrastructure, and global acceptance of usergenerated open content, the time is ripe to exploit the possibility of publishing more forms of scholarly contributions in a publicly available multimedia format (e.g., video). In this paper, we examine the feasibility of this proposal, develop a model to demonstrate the sustainability of this approach, and discuss potential limitations.},

It argues that reading and writing are central to the process of learning in any discipline and that discipline specialists need to take this into consideration when planning their curricula. It also considers what knowledge means in the context of academic literacies research and how this conception of knowledge may differ from the knowledge structures researchers' concern with knowledge as an object with its own properties. It comes to the conclusion that academic literacies research with its ethnographic-type exploration of social practice and theorisations of knowledge in the knowledge structures research can complement one another because each field of enquiry brings a lens that the other lacks.

The way that learning and the economic environment are framed impacts upon policy and funding decisions and has significant implications for the HE sector. The purpose of this paper is to explore how internships have become a key site in which policy and funding mechanisms seek to address concerns about graduate employability and graduate skills in relation to Scottish national economic plans and perceived business needs. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing from five years data generated from the Third Sector Internships Scotland programme, the authors adopt an approach to the analysis of policy and internship experiences based on a spatial perspective. The authors explore two spatial arenas in play; the conceptual space where discussion and policy making occur and the physical places of education and the workplace where learning takes place. The authors trace shifts in the policy and funding of higher education internship and work placement schemes and consider how these shifts respond to internship experiences of the workplace. Findings - The authors argue that changes within the conceptual and physical spaces intersect and that identifying contrasts and overlaps helps them to focus on particular questions about how internships develop learning for students. Originality/value - Taking the national approach within Scotland as a bounded case offers a unique opportunity to explore the ways in which internships have played an increasingly significant place as a pedagogic device operating at the borderlands between educational organisations and the physical spaces of employment.},

Furthermore, results from field studies suggest a positive impact of self-efficacy on flow experience, which has not yet been tested experimentally. In this study, we manipulated self-efficacy by means of positive feedback and investigated whether self-efficacy serves as a mediator in the relationship between positive feedback and flow and in the relationship between positive feedback and performance. Our sample consisted of 102 participants (63 female, 39 male). The experimental group received positive feedback after completing 5 min of mental arithmetic tasks on a computer, whereas the control group received no feedback. A second session of a mental arithmetic task was then completed for 5 min. Mediation analyses confirmed that specific self-efficacy mediated a positive effect of positive feedback on flow as well as on both performance measures (quality and quantity) in a subsequent task. However, direct effects of feedback on flow and on performance were not significant, which suggests the presence of other mechanisms that remain to be investigated.},

However, applying LLMs to real-world, mission-critical applications remains challenging mainly due to their tendency to generate hallucinations and their inability to use external knowledge. This paper proposes a LLM-Augmenter system, which augments a black-box LLM with a set of plug-and-play modules. Our system makes the LLM generate responses grounded in external knowledge, e.g., stored in task-specific databases. It also iteratively revises LLM prompts to improve model responses using feedback generated by utility functions, e.g., the factuality score of a LLM-generated response. The effectiveness of LLM-Augmenter is empirically validated on two types of scenarios, task-oriented dialog and open-domain question answering. LLM-Augmenter significantly reduces ChatGPT's hallucinations without sacrificing the fluency and informativeness of its responses. We make the source code and models publicly available.  15 pages},

With advances in computer technology, text analysis allows researchers to reliably and quickly assess features of what people say as well as subtleties in their linguistic styles. Following a brief review of several text analysis programs, we summarize some of the evidence that links natural word use to personality, social and situational fluctuations, and psychological interventions. Of particular interest are findings that point to the psychological value of studying particles-parts of speech that include pronouns, articles, prepositions, conjunctives, and auxiliary verbs. Particles, which serve as the glue that holds nouns and regular verbs together, can serve as markers of emotional state, social identity, and cognitive styles.},

However, the usefulness of these reflections for evaluation of progression in learning and professional development of students has to date not been evaluated. In order to analyse written reflections, two taxonomies developed by Bloom and Pettersen have been applied to the texts. Progression in the professional development of midwifery students can be seen through levels of complexity in cognitive and psycho-motor learning areas and also in the description of learning situations. Progression can be seen from a basic description of facts in simple situations at the beginning of the students' practice to a complex description of complicated situations towards the end of the practice. Written daily reflections appear to be a suitable method to help students to reflect in a structured way, thereby helping their professional development. Reflections can help clinical supervisors to understand the needs of the individual student and to support their knowledge accruement. Daily written reflections on clinical practice can be of use in other health education programs.},

The theory identifies the prerequisite conditions for disclosure and the message strategies a disclosing spouse may use to tell private information, as well as the strategic messages the marital partner may use to reply.

  abstract = {The chief objective in many online communities is to allow for knowledge sharing and learning, which is enabled by technologies such as discussion forums. The value realized from these communities depends on ongoing participation in terms of two key activities i.e., knowledge seeking and contribution. However, a large number of communities fail, as they cannot sustain these activities. This poses the question of how these two activities can be simultaneously promoted. While previous research has separately explicated a number of different antecedents for the two activities, this study adopts a socio-technical perspective of an online community and considers usability and sociability as two salient antecedents applicable to both activities. Usability and sociability are multi-dimensional constructs, where individual's perceptions of the two may be determined by dimensions such as ease of use and social interactivity. This paper proposes that individuals may place different importance on these dimensions when seeking knowledge, compared to contributing knowledge. The research model is tested through a survey of users of a learning-focused community system. Our findings indicate that individuals do, indeed, differ in their emphasis on the identified dimensions when they engage in the two activities. Specifically, ease of use and system reliability are considered as more important for usability, and moderator perception as more important for sociability when individuals seek knowledge. On the other hand, individuals perceive tracking fulfillment as more important for usability and social interactivity as more important for sociability when they contribute knowledge. These differences have implications for future research and practice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {During the fourth year of Amy Phillips' teaching assistantship in the spring semester of 2008, she was asked to teach a 300-level advanced writing course in which she was given the creative freedom to design the syllabus, choose the textbooks, craft all assignments, and organize the course content. However, there was one stipulation: the course, which was cross-listed with the Women and Gender Studies program, had to focus on the general topic of women and gender. In order to begin this task of designing her first 300-level writing course, within the requirements provided, Phillips used several of the strategies for course design offered by Linda B. Nilson in her book, "Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors." Firstly, she adopted a "course design by objectives" approach, which advocates "starting the course design process with what you want your students to be able to do by the end of the course" (Nilson 17). With respect to composition, Phillips wanted the culminating assignment in the class, or ultimate learning objective, to be a literary research paper (approximately 15-17 pages in length) that allowed each student to engage with a topic of his or her choice and design. Having established the larger goals of the course, she considered the following questions: How can one design an advanced writing course that enables students to achieve both community goals--in which all students learn and use the same writing skills--and individual goals--in which each student can apply those writing skills to a project that allows him or her to explore personal interests? How can one best use class time to create a foundation of writing skills and gender-based content while allowing students to develop independent critical thinking and writing skills? How can one successfully devote equal time to developing the topic of gender while focusing on the necessary advanced skills of composition, research, argument, and organization? In this essay Phillips outlines the manner in which she designed a course with such a specific focus on both content and rhetoric; discusses the structure of the course itself; and addresses the necessary recommendations she would make if given the opportunity to teach this course again.},

The roles of advice and feedback in the facilitation of on-line processing during acquisition and subsequent impact on memory-based processing during a delayed problem solving task (Phye, 1990) were studied. Results indicate that corrective feedback improves on-line processing during training and is reflected in acquisition performance and delayed retention. This finding with problem-solving tasks replicates prior research on corrective feedback with declarative knowledge. However, corrective feedback is not superior to advice in terms of influencing memory-based processing on a delayed problem-solving task requiring the use of strategic transfer as a tool.},

For-profit organizations and traditional institutions of higher education have developed and are using web-based courses, but little is known about their effectiveness compared to traditional classroom education. Our work focuses on the effectiveness of a web-based virtual learning environment (VLE) in the context of basic information technology skills training.  This article provides three main contributions. First, it introduces and defines the concept of VLE, discussing how a VLE differs from the traditional classroom and differentiating it from the related, but narrower, concept of computer aided instruction (CAI). Second, it presents a framework of VLE effectiveness, grounded in the technology-mediated learning literature, which frames the VLE research domain, and addresses the relationship between the main constructs. Finally, it focuses on one essential VLE design variable, learner control, and compares a web-based VLE to a traditional classroom through a longitudinal experimental design.  Our results indicate that, in the context of IT basic skills training in undergraduate education, there are no significant differences in performance between students enrolled in the two environments. However, the VLE leads to higher reported computer self-efficacy, while participants report being less satisfied with the learning process.

  abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

More specifically, the authors examine the effect of the proportion of group members exhibiting voice behavior in the group, the frequency of voice events in the group, and the measurement item referent (group vs. individual) on an individual's ratings of group voice behavior. In addition, the authors examine the effect that measurement item referent has on the magnitude of the relationship observed between an individual's ratings of group voice behavior and perceptions of group performance. Consistent with hypotheses, the results from 1 field study (N = 220) and 1 laboratory experiment (N = 366) indicate that: (a) When group referents were used, raters relied on the frequency of voice events (and not the proportion of group members exhibiting voice) to inform their ratings of voice behavior, whereas the opposite was true when individual-referent items were used, and (b) the magnitude of the relationship between observers' ratings of group voice behavior and their perceptions of group performance was higher when raters used group-referent, as opposed to an individual-referent, items. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for scholars interested in studying behavioral phenomena occurring in teams, groups, and work units in organizational behavior research.},

Using a case study methodology, this project documented the prototype-building, its implementation and gradual modification in response to faculty feedback.

In recent times, unhealthy outcomes from these systems have been highlighted including their vulnerability to amplifying small differences and offering less choice to readers. In this paper we present and study a new class of feedback models that exhibit a variety of self-organizing behaviors. In addition to showing important emergent properties, our model generalizes the popular "top-N news recommender systems" in a manner that provides media managers a mechanism to guide the emergent outcomes to mitigate potentially unhealthy outcomes driven by the self-organizing dynamics. We use complex adaptive systems framework to model the popularity evolution of news articles. In particular, we use agent-based simulation to model a reader's behavior at the microscopic level and study the impact of various simulation hyperparameters on overall emergent phenomena. This simulation exercise enables us to show how the feedback model can be used as an alternative recommender to conventional top-N systems. Finally, we present a design framework for multi-objective evolutionary optimization that enables recommendation systems to co-evolve with the changing online news readership landscape.},

  abstract = {A General Practitioner (GP) is no longer a loner, but a team player in either a group practice or a care centre. This change has led to a concomitant growth in curricular interest in skills essential for successful collaboration and for enhancing critical reflection towards colleagues' performance. Giving and receiving constructive feedback are examples of these skills. The aim of this study was to gain insight in the style and quality of feedback reports on consultation skills written by GPs-in-Training (GPiTs) and by their GP-trainers. Furthermore, the preferences of the GPiTs concerning feedback style were examined. Results show significant differences between GP-trainers and GPiTs in feedback style and quality. A ranking task indicated that GPiTs have a preference for reports characterised by a large number of reflective remarks. Questionnaire results indicate the added value of the use of peer feedback. Implications for the integration of peer feedback activities in the curriculum of GPiTs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Organizational research and practice involving ratings are rife with what the authors term ill-structured measurement designs (ISMDs)--designs in which raters and ratees are neither fully crossed nor nested. This article explores the implications of ISMDs for estimating interrater reliability. The authors first provide a mock example that illustrates potential problems that ISMDs create for common reliability estimators (e.g., Pearson correlations, intraclass correlations). Next, the authors propose an alternative reliability estimator--G(q,k)--that resolves problems with traditional estimators and is equally appropriate for crossed, nested, and ill-structured designs. By using Monte Carlo simulation, the authors evaluate the accuracy of traditional reliability estimators compared with that of G(q,k) for ratings arising from ISMDs. Regardless of condition, G(q,k) yielded estimates as precise or more precise than those of traditional estimators. The advantage of G(q,k) over the traditional estimators became more pronounced with increases in the (a) overlap between the sets of raters that rated each ratee and (b) ratio of rater main effect variance to true score variance. Discussion focuses on implications of this work for organizational research and practice.},

More recent definitions have questioned this approach, arguing that the impact of feedback lies in learner acceptance and assimilation of feedback with improvement in practice and professional growth. Over the last decade, research findings have emphasized that feedback conversations are complex interpersonal interactions influenced by a multitude of sociocultural factors. However, feedback culture is a concept that is challenging to define, thus strategies to enhance culture are difficult to pin down. In this twelve tips paper, we have attempted to define elements that constitute a feedback culture from four different perspectives and describe distinct strategies that can be used to foster a learning culture with a growth mind-set.},

This article describes how one university instructor defined and applied the principles of Universal Instructional Design (UID) to pedagogy, while designing three online courses. The paper presents the course design process, detailing how UD principles can be operationalised to increase `cognitive access' through a variety of pedagogical practices. The paper illustrates ways in which instructors can consider UID during the five phases of instructional design (analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation). The courses highlighted in this study incorporated varied assignment formats, flexible options, a highly structured format and regular interactions with peers and instructors. Results of the study show that students valued the organisation, instructor interaction and flexible options provided. Implications for practice are presented for instructors seeking to design inclusive course environments.

  abstract = {Objective: Acquisition and application of professional and personal competences is accompanied by the formation and consolidation of attitudes and values and is influenced by the norms and moods (trust and feedback culture) experienced in the learning environment in question [1]. In particular, feedback and peer feedback can have a positive influence on the learning progress and personal development of students [2], [3], [4]. The promotion of a culture of teaching and ultimately of trust or feedback, plays a special role in this [5]. The aim was therefore to structurally integrate feedback into the curriculum of a model study course in order to develop a feedback culture in which students can develop personally and professionally with the help of regular and constructive feedback. Methodology: Following an initial pilot phase in 2009, (peer) feedback was gradually integrated into the curriculum at the medical faculty, in the first instance through checklists and subsequently through an online questionnaire and direct interviews. The activities were regularly analyzed on the basis of student evaluations using the EvaSys evaluation software and semi-standardized questionnaire-based interviews with six students in 2009 and 13 students each in 2012 and 2013. Results: Initially, students felt that the trust and feedback culture at their location as being in need of improvement. There were uncertainties regarding the use of constructive feedback and making criticism but also trust issues regarding the expression of personal perceptions to faculty members. It was possible to document the increase in the acceptance of the offers in the course of their establishment by an improvement in student evaluation and an increase in the number of participants in the voluntary offers amongst others. Qualitative data showed that students had a more positive perception or assessment of the location's feedback concept as well as indications of improvements in the culture of trust at the location. The proportion of constructive free-text comments increased significantly by 11\% to 99.4\% compared to the previous year (t(3)=-3.79, p=0.04). Thus, in terms of the objective, an increase in feedback activities and their quality at the faculty was achieved. Conclusion: Feedback, its acceptance as well as the quality, can be positively influenced at a faculty. Change measures should be tested repeatedly in discussion with users regarding practicability in order to directly pick up implementation issues and obstacles so they can be remedied in the interests of the users. This can influence the development of a culture of trust and feedback and should promote the personal and professional development of students in the long term.  Zielsetzung: Das Erlernen und Anwenden von fachlichen, aber auch pers{\"o}nlichen Kompetenzen geht mit der Formung und Festigung von Einstellungen und Werten einher und wird durch die, in der spezifischen Lernumgebung gelebten, Normen und Stimmungen (Vertrauens- und Feedbackkultur) beeinflusst [1]. Insbesondere Feedback und auch Peer-Feedback k{\"o}nnen hier einen positiven Einfluss auf den Lernfortschritt und die pers{\"o}nliche Entwicklung von Studierenden haben [2], [3], [4]. Der F{\"o}rderung einer Lehr- und letztlich Vertrauens- bzw. Feedbackkultur kommt dabei eine besondere Rolle zu [5]. Ziel war es deshalb, Feedback strukturiert in das Curriculum eines Modellstudiengangs zu integrieren, um dar{\"u}ber eine Feedbackkultur zu entwickeln, in der Studierende sich mit Hilfe von regelm{\"a}{\ss}igem und konstruktivem Feedback pers{\"o}nlich wie auch fachlich weiterentwickeln k{\"o}nnen.Methodik: Nach einer initialen Pilotphase 2009 wurde (Peer-) Feedback zun{\"a}chst anhand von Checklisten, sp{\"a}ter durch einen Online-Fragebogen und direkte Gespr{\"a}chssituationen sukzessive in das Curriculum an der Medizinischen Fakult{\"a}t integriert und die Aktivit{\"a}ten regelm{\"a}{\ss}ig auf Basis studentischer Evaluationen mittels der Evaluationssoftware EvaSys sowie halbstandardisierter, leitfragengest{\"u}tzter Interviews mit sechs Studierenden in 2009 und jeweils 13 Studierenden in 2012 und 2013 analysiert. Ergebnisse: Studierende nahmen die Vertrauens- bzw. Feedbackkultur am Standort zun{\"a}chst noch verbesserungsw{\"u}rdig wahr. Es zeigten sich Unsicherheiten mit Blick auf die Verwendung von konstruktivem Feedback und dem Geben von Kritik, aber auch Misstrauen mit Bezug zur {\"A}u{\ss}erung pers{\"o}nlicher Wahrnehmungen gegen{\"u}ber Fakult{\"a}tsmitarbeitern. Die Steigerung der Akzeptanz der Angebote im Verlauf ihrer Etablierung konnte u.a. {\"u}ber eine Verbesserung der studentischen Evaluation und eine Erh{\"o}hung der Teilnehmerzahlen an den freiwilligen Angeboten dokumentiert werden. In qualitativen Daten zeigte sich unter den Studierenden eine positivere Wahrnehmung bzw. Bewertung des standorteigenen Feedbackkonzepts sowie Hinweise auf Verbesserungen der Vertrauenskultur am Standort. Der Anteil konstruktiver Freitextkommentare stieg signifikant um 11\% auf 99,4\% im Vergleich zum Vorjahr (t(3)=-3,79, p=0,04). So konnte im Sinne der Zielsetzung schon eine Steigerung von Feedbackaktivit{\"a}ten sowie deren Qualit{\"a}t an der Fakult{\"a}t erreicht werden.Schlussfolgerung: Feedback, dessen Akzeptanz sowie die Qualit{\"a}t k{\"o}nnen in einer Fakult{\"a}t positiv beeinflusst werden. Dabei sollen Ver{\"a}nderungsma{\ss}nahmen immer wieder im Diskurs mit den Anwendern auf Praktikabilit{\"a}t gepr{\"u}ft werden, um Umsetzungsschwierigkeiten und Hemmnisse direkt wahrzunehmen und im Sinne der Anwender zu beeinflussen. Dies kann die Entwicklung einer Vertrauens- bzw. Feedbackkultur beeinflussen und sollte langfristig die pers{\"o}nliche und fachliche Entwicklung Studierender f{\"o}rdern.},

It is argued that research on eye movements during reading has been somewhat advanced over research on eye movements in scene perception and visual search and that some of the paradigms developed to study reading should be more widely adopted in the study of scene perception and visual search. Research dealing with "real-world" tasks and research utilizing the visual-world paradigm are also briefly discussed.},

Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories and forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a set of six core emotional arcs which form the essential building blocks of complex emotional trajectories. We strengthen our findings by separately applying matrix decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.},

  abstract = {Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products). In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.  Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)},

In this paper, we show that running baselines properly is difficult. We demonstrate this issue on two extensively studied datasets. First, we show that results for baselines that have been used in numerous publications over the past five years for the Movielens 10M benchmark are suboptimal. With a careful setup of a vanilla matrix factorization baseline, we are not only able to improve upon the reported results for this baseline but even outperform the reported results of any newly proposed method. Secondly, we recap the tremendous effort that was required by the community to obtain high quality results for simple methods on the Netflix Prize. Our results indicate that empirical findings in research papers are questionable unless they were obtained on standardized benchmarks where baselines have been tuned extensively by the research community.},

However, students are often not experts in how to write helpful feedback to their fellow students. In this paper, we introduce a corpus compiled from university students' peer feedback to be able to detect suggestions on how to improve the students' work and therefore being able to capture peer feedback helpfulness. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is the first student peer feedback corpus in German which additionally was labelled with a new annotation scheme. The corpus consists of more than 600 written feedback (about 7,500 sentences). The utilisation of the corpus is broadly ranged from Dependency Parsing to Sentiment Analysis to Suggestion Mining, etc. We applied the latter to empirically validate the utility of the new corpus. Suggestion Mining is the extraction of sentences that contain suggestions from unstructured text. In this paper, we present a new annotation scheme to label sentences for Suggestion Mining. Two independent annotators labelled the corpus and achieved an inter-annotator agreement of 0.71. With the help of an expert arbitrator a gold standard was created. An automatic classification using BERT achieved an accuracy of 75.3\%.}

  abstract = {With the growth of online learning through MOOCs and other educational applications, it has become increasingly difficult for course providers to offer personalized feedback to students. Therefore asking students to provide feedback to each other has become one way to support learning. This peer-to-peer feedback has become increasingly important whether in MOOCs to provide feedback to thousands of students or in large-scale classes at universities. One of the challenges when allowing peer-to-peer feedback is that the feedback should be perceived as helpful, and an import factor determining helpfulness is how specific the feedback is. However, in classes including thousands of students, instructors do not have the resources to check the specificity of every piece of feedback between students. Therefore, we present an automatic classification model to measure sentence specificity in written feedback. The model was trained and tested on student feedback texts written in German where sentences have been labelled as general or specific. We find that we can automatically classify the sentences with an accuracy of 76.7\% using a conventional feature-based approach, whereas transfer learning with BERT for German gives a classification accuracy of 81.1\%. However, the feature-based approach comes with lower computational costs and preserves human interpretability of the coefficients. In addition we show that specificity of sentences in feedback texts has a weak positive correlation with perceptions of helpfulness. This indicates that specificity is one of the ingredients of good feedback, and invites further investigation.}

Prominent methods, such as elicitation interviews, are challenging to apply in such a context, as time and location constraints limit potential audiences. [Research Method] The presented dissertation project utilizes design science research to develop a requirements self-elicitation system, LadderBot. A conversational agent (CA) enables end-users to articulate needs and requirements on the grounds of the laddering method. The CA mimics a human interviewer's capability to rephrase questions and provide assistance in the process and allows users to converse in their natural language. Furthermore, the tool will assist requirements analysts with the subsequent aggregation and analysis of collected data. [Contribution] The dissertation project makes a practical contribution in the form of a ready-to-use system for wide audience end-user RE and subsequent analysis utilizing laddering as cognitive elicitation technique. A theoretical contribution is provided by developing a design theory for the application of conversational agents for RE, including the laboratory and field evaluation of design principles.},

  abstract = {[Context] Digital transformation impacts an ever-increasing amount of everyone's business and private life. It is imperative to incorporate user requirements in the development process to design successful information systems (IS). Hence, requirements elicitation (RE) is increasingly performed by users that are novices at contributing requirements to IS development projects. [Objective] We need to develop RE systems that are capable of assisting a wide audience of users in communicating their needs and requirements. Prominent methods, such as elicitation interviews, are challenging to apply in such a context, as time and location constraints limit potential audiences. [Research Method] We present the prototypical self-elicitation system "LadderBot". A conversational agent (CA) enables end-users to articulate needs and requirements on the grounds of the laddering method. The CA mimics a human (expert) interviewer's capability to rephrase questions and provide assistance in the process. An experimental study is proposed to evaluate LadderBot against an established questionnaire-based laddering approach. [Contribution] This work-in-progress introduces the chatbot LadderBot as a tool to guide novice users during requirements self-elicitation using the laddering technique. Furthermore, we present the design of an experimental study and outline the next steps and a vision for the future.},

Despite its significance, implementing process mining to leverage data-driven decision-making and boosting process efficiency presents notable challenges for such companies. This case study delves into the journey of the fictitious Swiss luxury retailer Elysian as they utilize process mining to derive data-driven insights on process inefficiencies and bottlenecks to increase their customer excellence for online retail procurement. The case highlights the capabilities of process mining for organizations. It is among the first to offer students hands-on guidance on process discovery, conformance, and enhancement using real-world data. Students take the role of Lisa Dister, Head of procurement in the business unit home care, who urgently requires improving process transparency after an unsatisfying internal audit result. This immersive experience helps students understand the application of process mining in high-volume data scenarios and equips them with skills in data literacy. Moreover, students are challenged to suggest recommendations for long-term process optimization and reflect on the effectiveness of process mining for tackling procurement issues.},

Such personalization is expected to increase employees' empowerment, job satisfaction, and learning outcomes. However, the challenge lies in efficiently deploying these opportunities using novel technologies, prompting questions about the design and analysis of generating personalized learning paths in organizational learning. We, therefore, analyze and classify recent research on personalized learning paths into four major concepts (learning context, data, interface, and adaptation) with ten dimensions and 34 characteristics. Six expert interviews validate the taxonomy's use and outline three exemplary use cases, undermining its feasibility. Information Systems researchers can use our taxonomy to develop theoretical models to study the effectiveness of personalized learning paths in intra-organizational re-\&upskilling.},

In addition, the results showed that the motivating effects of feedback accuracy partially occurred through procedural justice perceptions. Tests of an alternative model also demonstrated the interactive effects of credibility and accuracy on justice perceptions. Overall, this study provides insight into the role of fairness in appraisal processes, as well as how fairness might enhance recipients' reactions to appraisal and, subsequently, the effectiveness of appraisal systems.},

The proposed mediational model was supported with empirical results from 150 subordinate-supervisor dyads sampled across a variety of organizations. Higher quality feedback environments were associated with lower perceptions of organizational politics, and morale mediated the relationships between organizational politics and various aspects of work performance. These findings suggest that when employees have greater access to information regarding behaviors that are acceptable and desired at work, perceptions of politics are reduced and work outcomes are enhanced.},

  abstract = {Background: "Open peer review" (OPR), despite being a major pillar of Open Science, has neither a standardized definition nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations. The literature reflects this, with numerous overlapping and contradictory definitions. While for some the term refers to peer review where the identities of both author and reviewer are disclosed to each other, for others it signifies systems where reviewer reports are published alongside articles. For others it signifies both of these conditions, and for yet others it describes systems where not only "invited experts" are able to comment. For still others, it includes a variety of combinations of these and other novel methods. Methods: Recognising the absence of a consensus view on what open peer review is, this article undertakes a systematic review of definitions of "open peer review" or "open review", to create a corpus of 122 definitions. These definitions are systematically analysed to build a coherent typology of the various innovations in peer review signified by the term, and hence provide the precise technical definition currently lacking. Results: This quantifiable data yields rich information on the range and extent of differing definitions over time and by broad subject area. Quantifying definitions in this way allows us to accurately portray exactly how ambiguously the phrase "open peer review" has been used thus far, for the literature offers 22 distinct configurations of seven traits, effectively meaning that there are 22 different definitions of OPR in the literature reviewed. Conclusions: I propose a pragmatic definition of open peer review as an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.},

  abstract = {Citation: Rubin, M. (2017). Do p values lose their meaning in exploratory analyses? It depends how you define the familywise error rate. Abstract Several researchers have recently argued that p values lose their meaning in exploratory analyses due to an unknown inflation of the alpha level (e.g., Nosek \& Lakens, 2014; Wagenmakers, 2016). For this argument to be tenable, the familywise error rate must be defined in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested in the same study or article. Under this conceptualization, the familywise error rate is usually unknowable in exploratory analyses because it is usually unclear how many hypotheses have been tested on a spontaneous basis and then omitted from the final research report. In the present article, I argue that it is inappropriate to conceptualize the familywise error rate in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested. Instead, it is more appropriate to conceptualize familywise error in relation to the number of different tests that are conducted on the same null hypothesis in the same study. Under this conceptualization, alpha level adjustments in exploratory analyses are (a) less necessary and (b) objectively verifiable. As a result, p values do not lose their meaning in exploratory analyses.},

  abstract = {This research concerns the potential of online teaching to prompt university faculty members to reflect on the essence of good teaching, and as a result enhance their pedagogy in both online and face-to-face courses. Ideas of developmental psychologists melded with related concepts from online-learning theorists were used as a theoretical framework for identifying key cognitive steps in the process of rethinking what it means to teach well. In particular, catalysts that can help motivate faculty to rethink teaching were suggested by the views of developmental psychologists Vygotsky, Piaget and Bruner about the social context within which learning takes place, the advantages of learning from and with peers, and the value of cognitive dissonance as an impetus to learning; additional catalysts were suggested by the views of online-learning theorists Dede, Ally, Mayes, Moore and Swann about the ways that innovative technologies and web-based learning affect how people interact. To investigate how, and the degree to which, these potential catalysts actually come into play in online teaching, a phenomenological research study was carried out based on interviews with six experienced university faculty members concerning their experiences designing and teaching online courses, with special emphasis on how their views of good teaching may have changed during that process. The study highlighted catalysts that in most but not all cases helped to bring about the faculty members' re-examination of pedagogical assumptions as they planned and taught online courses and reflected on the experience. The catalysts included the novel online-learning environment, new roles and relationships the participants encountered during the process of teaching online, the unfamiliar course-design process, and new forms of interaction they encountered. As more students take courses online and more faculty members are called upon to teach such courses, institutions of higher education have an opportunity to improve pedagogy both by tapping into teachers' passion for teaching and by making the most of the catalysts illuminated in this study.

  abstract = {Despite widespread acknowledgement that Internet access in libraries and schools is filtered, the effects of that filtering on faculty who must utilize such a system for research, teaching, and curriculum development in American higher education are not known. This qualitative case study explored faculty experiences of Internet filtering in terms of its effect on curriculum development, teaching effectiveness, and ability to conduct research at a Midwestern proprietary higher education institution. The phenomenological approach of Van Manen was used because of its focus on accessing the lived experiences of participants with the purpose of formulating recommendations for action. Moustakas' heuristic method, which deliberately incorporates the person of the researcher, was used to gather and interpret interview data collected from a purposeful, non-probability, convenience sample of 10 faculty members from the target institution. Results showed that the presence of an Internet filter has negative consequences for faculty's ability to prepare for and conduct their classes. However, the present findings also showed that faculty's ability to develop curriculum was not at issue because of the institution's policy to provide a pre-set curriculum. General recommendations include faculty involvement in setting Internet policies, differentiated access based on user type, and further research in diverse settings. Institution-specific recommendations include abolishing filtering for faculty or, if the filter is continued, involving faculty in its development/revision, clearly communicating the filtering policy, and further research into the impact of the system on all faculty.},

However, employee engagement has rarely been studied in the academic literature and relatively little is known about its antecedents and consequences. The purpose of this study was to test a model of the antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagements based on social exchange theory. Design/methodology/approach A survey was completed by 102 employees working in a variety of jobs and organizations. The average age was 34 and 60 percent were female. Participants had been in their current job for an average of four years, in their organization an average of five years, and had on average 12 years of work experience. The survey included measures of job and organization engagement as well as the antecedents and consequences of engagement. Findings Results indicate that there is a meaningful difference between job and organization engagements and that perceived organizational support predicts both job and organization engagement; job characteristics predicts job engagement; and procedural justice predicts organization engagement. In addition, job and organization engagement mediated the relationships between the antecedents and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, intentions to quit, and organizational citizenship behavior. Originality/value This is the first study to make a distinction between job and organization engagement and to measure a variety of antecedents and consequences of job and organization engagement. As a result, this study addresses concerns about that lack of academic research on employee engagement and speculation that it might just be the latest management fad.},

  abstract = {As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely used to model and simulate human behavior, understanding their biases becomes critical. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.},

  abstract = {Functional connectivity analyses are typically based on matrices containing bivariate measures of covariability, such as correlations. Although this has been a fruitful approach, it may not be the optimal strategy to fully explore the complex associations underlying brain activity. Here, we propose extending connectivity to multivariate functions relating to the temporal dynamics of a region with the rest of the brain. The main technical challenges of such an approach are multidimensionality and its associated risk of overfitting or even the non-uniqueness of model solutions. To minimize these risks, and as an alternative to the more common dimensionality reduction methods, we propose using two regularized multivariate connectivity models. On the one hand, simple linear functions of all brain nodes were fitted with ridge regression. On the other hand, a more flexible approach to avoid linearity and additivity assumptions was implemented through random forest regression. Similarities and differences between both methods and with simple averages of bivariate correlations (i.e., weighted global brain connectivity) were evaluated on a resting state sample of N = 173 healthy subjects. Results revealed distinct connectivity patterns from the two proposed methods, which were especially relevant in the age-related analyses where both ridge and random forest regressions showed significant patterns of age-related disconnection, almost completely absent from the much less sensitive global brain connectivity maps. On the other hand, the greater flexibility provided by the random forest algorithm allowed detecting sex-specific differences. The generic framework of multivariate connectivity implemented here may be easily extended to other types of regularized models.},

  abstract = {Technology-mediated learning methods are widely used by organizations and educational institutions to deliver information technology training. One form of technology-mediated learning, e-learning, in which the platform is the tutor, is quickly becoming the cost-effective solution of choice for many corporations. Unfortunately, the learning outcomes have been very disappointing. E-learning training makes an implicit assumption that learners can apply a high level of self-directed learning to assimilate the training content. In contrast, based on perspectives from social cognitive theory, we propose that instructional strategies need to persuade learners to follow self-regulated learning strategies. We test our ideas with participants who were trained through e-learning to design a website. Our findings indicate that participants who were induced to follow self-regulated learning strategies scored significantly higher on learning outcomes than those who were not persuaded to do so. We discuss our findings, and suggest that the interaction among information technology features, instructional strategies, and psychological learning processes offers a fruitful avenue for future information systems training research.

  abstract = {Gamification, an application of game design elements to non-gaming contexts, is proposed as a way to add engagement in technology-mediated training programs. Yet there is hardly any information on how to adapt game design elements to improve learning outcomes and promote learner engagement. To address this issue, we focus on a popular game design element, competition, and specifically examine the effects of different competitive structures, i.e., whether a person faces a higher-skilled, lower-skilled or equally-skilled competitor, on learning and engagement. We study a gamified training design for databases, where trainees play a trivia-based mini-game with a competitor after each e-training module. Trainees who faced a lower-skilled competitor reported higher self-efficacy beliefs and better learning outcomes, supporting the effect of peer appraisal, a less examined aspect of social cognitive theory. Yet trainees who faced equally-skilled competitors reported higher levels of engagement, supporting the balance principle of flow theory. Our study findings indicate that no one competitive structure can simultaneously address learning and engagement outcomes. The choice of competitive structures depends on the priority of the outcomes in training. Our findings provide one explanation for the mixed findings on the effect of competitive gamification designs in technology mediated training.

Recent research indicates that reversing this widely used tell-and-practice sequence (T\&P) so that exploratory problem-solving precedes the instructional explanation (i.e., PS-I) might be more beneficial. We aimed to replicate this advantage, but we also hypothesized based on previous research that the effectiveness of PS-I would depend on how scaffolding prompts and specific ways of representing the problems are combined. In an in vivo experimental classroom study, 213 ninth graders were randomly allocated to either a T\&P or 1 of 4 PS-I conditions (in a 2 {\texttimes} 2 design). In all PS-I conditions, exploratory problem-solving consisted of a comparing and contrasting cases activity. However, we varied whether the students processed grounded or idealized cases (containing or stripped off contextual detail, respectively) and whether the activity was scaffolded by an invention or a self-explanation prompt. We assessed transfer performance immediately after learning and 4 weeks later. The PS-I sequences were not generally more effective than the T\&P sequence, the effectiveness was influenced by an interaction of scaffolding prompts and problem representation. Immediately after learning, T\&P students were only outperformed by students who learned with grounded cases and self-explanation prompts, by students who learned with grounded cases and invention prompts, and by students who learned with idealized cases and invention prompts; only the latter retained this advantage 4 weeks after learning. We discuss potential reasons and emphasize that PS-I sequences demand careful design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results from a number of studies are presented that indicate the importance of interest for the depth of text comprehension, the use of learning strategies, and the quality of the emotional experience while learning.

  abstract = {While 3D virtual worlds are more frequently being used as interactive environments for collaboration, there is still no structured approach developed specifically for the combined design of 3D virtual environments and the collaborative activities in them. We argue that formalizing both the structural elements of virtual worlds and aspects of collaborative work or collaborative learning helps to develop fruitful collaborative work and learning experiences. As such, we present the avatar-based collaboration framework (ABC framework). Based on semiotics theory, the framework puts the collaborating groups into the center of the design and emphasizes the use of distinct features of 3D virtual worlds for use in collaborative learning environments and activities. In developing the framework, we have drawn from best practices in instructional design and game design, research in HCI, and findings and observations from our own empirical research that investigates collaboration patterns in virtual worlds. Along with the framework, we present a case study of its first application for a global collaborative learning project. This paper particularly addresses virtual world designers, educators, meeting facilitators, and other practitioners by thoroughly describing the process of creating rich collaboration and collaborative learning experiences for virtual worlds with the ABC framework.

Earlier, Lavery (1962) showed that, relative to providing KR after each trial, a 20-trial summary KR was detrimental to performance in a practice phase with KR present but was beneficial for a no-KR retention test. Using a relatively simple ballistic-timing task, we examined summary lengths of 1 (essentially KR after every trial), 5, 10, and 15 trials, searching for an inverted-U relationship between summary length and retention performance as predicated by a guidance hypothesis for KR. During acquisition when KR was present and being manipulated, all groups showed improvements in performance across practice, while increased summary lengths generally depressed performance. However, in a delayed no-KR retention test, there was an inverse relation between the summary length in acquisition and absolute constant error on the retention test. A guidance hypothesis is favored to explain how, relative to immediate KR, long KR summaries can provide detrimental effects in acquisition while enhancing retention performance.},

Using them as pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended state of the art for many NLP tasks and shown that they capture not only linguistic knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerated and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show that recent LMs also contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, some form of ethical and moral norms of the society -- they bring a "moral direction" to surface. That is, we show that these norms can be captured geometrically by a direction, which can be computed, e.g., by a PCA, in the embedding space, reflecting well the agreement of phrases to social norms implicitly expressed in the training texts and providing a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs. Being able to rate the (non-)normativity of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, we demonstrate the capabilities of the "moral direction" for guiding (even other) LMs towards producing normative text and showcase it on RealToxicityPrompts testbed, preventing the neural toxic degeneration in GPT-2.},

Initially dismissed as environments of play, virtual worlds have gained legitimacy in business and educational settings for their application in globally distributed work, project management, online learning, and real-time simulation. Understanding the emergent aspects of these virtual worlds and their implications for organizations will require both new theories and new methods. We propose that a performative perspective may be particularly useful as it challenges the existence of independent objects with fixed or given properties and boundaries, and focuses instead on situated and relational practices that enact entangled and contingent boundaries, entities, identities, and effects.

We identify initial design principles based on salient affordances required in organisational sensemaking and revise them through three rounds of developing, demonstrating and evaluating a prototypical implementation. Through our analysis, we learn how IS can support essential sensemaking practices in environmental sustainability transformations, including experiencing disruptive ambiguity through the provision of environmental data, noticing and bracketing, engaging in an open and inclusive communication and presuming potential alternative environmentally responsible actions. We make two key contributions: First, we provide a set of theory-inspired design principles for IS that support sensemaking in sustainability transformations, and revise them empirically using a DSR method. Second, we show how the concept of affordances can be used in DSR to investigate how IS can support organisational practices. While our findings are based on the investigation of the substantive context of environmental sustainability transformation, we suggest that they might be applicable in a broader set of contexts of organisational sensemaking and thus for a broader class of sensemaking support systems.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to finding effective ways of preventing errors from occurring during training. Recently, some researchers have adopted a different perspective: that errors may provide a learning opportunity for trainees. What has been investigated less is the specific mechanism through which errors can foster learning. The objective of our research was to investigate and possibly reconcile these differing viewpoints by examining the error recovery process. We found that, in some situations, errors enhance learning when the trainee adopts an error recovery process that emphasizes the goal structure of the task. We suggest several ways of coaching trainees in training sessions to adopt such error recovery strategies.},

  abstract = {Rule-based reasoning, a fundamental type of legal reasoning, enables us to draw conclusions by accurately applying a rule to a set of facts. We explore causal language models as rule-based reasoners, specifically with respect to compositional rules - rules consisting of multiple elements which form a complex logical expression. Reasoning about compositional rules is challenging because it requires multiple reasoning steps, and attending to the logical relationships between elements. We introduce a new prompting method, Chain of Logic, which elicits rule-based reasoning through decomposition (solving elements as independent threads of logic), and recomposition (recombining these sub-answers to resolve the underlying logical expression). This method was inspired by the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) framework, a sequential reasoning approach used by lawyers. We evaluate chain of logic across eight rule-based reasoning tasks involving three distinct compositional rules from the LegalBench benchmark and demonstrate it consistently outperforms other prompting methods, including chain of thought and self-ask, using open-source and commercial language models.},

This paper describes the course redesign process of a post-baccalaureate course from a face-to-face delivery to a blended learning model. The course transformation was based on four principles of course redesign gleaned from the current research. A model matrix of content delivery methods, student activities, and technology tools is included. This course was implemented in fall 2014 with online activities for two-thirds of the course and face-to-face activities for one-third. On completion, students were surveyed on their involvement and satisfaction with the blended model. The survey results were positive.}

STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline.  For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25\% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10\%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.},

However, research on DL, which includes psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills, is virtually nonexistent. Indeed, DL for psychomotor skills has been viewed as impossible. Laboratory coursework, which we define as including the acquisition of psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills, has become a limiting factor in the growth of DL. What is needed is a synergistic integration of technologies and human-computer interface (HCI) principles from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), collaborative learning systems, and immersive presence technologies to enable achievement of psychomotor learning objectives. This paper defines the computer-supported collaborative learning requiring immersive presence (CSCLIP) research area, provides a theoretical foundation for CSCLIP, and develops an agenda for research in CSCLIP to establish a foundation for the study of this emerging area. It also briefly describes a CSCLIP-based telecommunications lab currently under development. CSCLIP is presented as a major research opportunity for information systems researchers interested in empirical research as well as technical development.

Using six intact adult ESL intermediate classes totaling 80 students, four groups were formed: Focused Written CF group (FG, n=22), Unfocused Written CF group (UG, n=23), Writing Practice Group (WPG, n=16) and Control Group (CG, n=19). A series of ANOVAs with post-hoc comparisons indicated that all three experimental groups (FG, UG and WPG) gained in grammatical accuracy over time in all the posttests. This suggested that doing writing tasks is of value by itself. The FG achieved the highest accuracy gain scores for both articles and the other four grammatical structures (i.e., copular `be', regular past tense, irregular past tense and preposition), followed by, in order, the WPG, UG and CG. Overall, these results suggested that unfocused CF is of limited pedagogical value whereas focused CF can contribute to grammatical accuracy in L2 writing.},

Learning has been defined as a stable and persistent change in what a person knows and can do. Learning is formed through an individual's interactions, including the conveyance of knowledge and skills from others and experiences. So, learning is a personalized experience that allows one to expand their knowledge, perspective, skills, and understanding. Therefore, personalized learning models can help to meet individual needs and goals. Furthermore, to personalize the learning experience, technology integration can play a crucial role. This paper provides a review of the recent research literature on personalized learning as technology is changing how learning can be effectively personalized. The emphasis is on the terms used to characterize learning as those can suggest a framework for personalized and will eventually be used in meta-analyses of research on personalized learning, which is beyond the scope of this paper.},

Agility has relationships with trainable physical qualities such as strength, power and technique, as well as cognitive components such as visual-scanning techniques, visual-scanning speed and anticipation. Agility testing is generally confined to tests of physical components such as change of direction speed, or cognitive components such as anticipation and pattern recognition.

However, recent research has suggested that sometimes, rather than encourage positive outcomes for teams, voice from members can have detrimental consequences. Extending this research, we highlight why it is important to consider voice centralization within teams, or the extent to which voice is predominantly emanating from only a few members rather than equally spread across all members. We argue that, under certain circumstances, voice centralization is harmful to the utilization of members' expertise in the team and, thereby, to team performance. Specifically, we propose that voice centralization is likely to have negative effects when it occurs around members who are more socially dominant or are less reflective. We find support for our arguments in a sample of 78 teams (319 team members) working on graduate student projects in a business school over a semester. Overall, through our theory and results, we showcase why it is important for future studies to examine the distribution of voice among team members. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Results from 5 studies, utilizing diverse methodologies and samples, support our hypothesis that the relationship between self-efficacy and feedback seeking depends on the extent to which one engages in perspective taking. In the absence of perspective taking, self-efficacy tends to be more negatively related to feedback seeking. However, when perspective taking occurs, this relationship tends to be more positive. We also provide evidence that this interaction effect is mediated by perceptions of the value of feedback. We discuss the implications of our theory and findings for the feedback seeking literature and more broadly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

While everybody else may see a co-worker's incompetence, the employee is clueless about his or her serious development need. It may not be enough to provide feedback to this type of employee and hope that performance will improve. However, ignoring feedback has serious consequences for both the individual and the organization. Based on Hanna's individual change model from the therapeutic literature, we argue that individual and organizational factors, or precursors, enhance the speed of individual change in response to feedback. The individual precursors increase the likelihood that an employee will change in response to performance feedback, while the organizational precursors reflect how an organization's environment supports and rewards individual change. Individual change will occur more quickly and effectively to the extent that these precursors are present. This paper describes the precursors, provides a tool that managers can use to assess the precursors, and presents a case example to illustrate these points.]},

Its purpose was to determine which training methods could best be utilized in computer related training to maximize a trainee's retention of material and transfer of learning. A field experiment was conducted using two hundred members of active duty US. Naval Construction Battalion as subjects. Evaluation of trainees included a pre-training screening, post-training evaluation (immediately after training), and a follow-up session (four weeks after the post-training session) utilizing previously validated instruments. Training treatments included instruction (lecture), exploration (independent study), and a nontraditional technique--- behavior modeling (an enhanced combination of the other two methods). Performance outcomes were operationalized using hands-on task performance and comprehension of the computer system as dependent variables. End-user satisfaction with the computer system was also measured. Two covariates, cognitive ability and system use, were also introduced into the study. The use of hands-on training methods, especially behavior modeling, resulted in superior retention of knowledge, transfer of Learning, and end-user satisfaction. Cognitive ability failed to be a good predictor of trainee success but a connection was established between training methodology, system use, and end-user satisfaction [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]    Copyright of Information Systems Research is the property of INFORMS: Institute for Operations Research and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Machine Learning with PySpark shows you how to build supervised machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest. You'll also see unsupervised machine learning models such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. A major portion of the book focuses on feature engineering to create useful features with PySpark to train the machine learning models. The natural language processing section covers text processing, text mining, and embedding for classification. After reading this book, you will understand how to use PySpark's machine learning library to build and train various machine learning models. Additionally you'll become comfortable with related PySpark components, such as data ingestion, data processing, and data analysis, that you can use to develop data-driven intelligent applications.

  abstract = {Self-disclosure in human--chatbot relationship (HCR) formation has attracted substantial interest. According to social penetration theory, self-disclosure varies in breadth and depth and is influenced by perceived rewards and costs. While previous research has addressed self-disclosure in the context of chatbots, little is known about users' qualitative understanding of such self-disclosure and how self-disclosure develops in HCR. To close this gap, we conducted a 12-week qualitative longitudinal study (n~=~28) with biweekly questionnaire-based check-ins. Our results show that while HCRs display substantial conversational breadth, with topics spanning from emotional issues to everyday activities, this may be reduced as the HCR matures. Our results also motivate a nuanced understanding of conversational depth, where even conversations about daily activities or play and fantasy can be experienced as personal or intimate. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that conversational depth can develop in at least four ways, influenced by perceived rewards and costs. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Recent studies of feedback-timing effects have suggested that feedback might also strengthen initially correct responses. In an experiment involving cued recall of trivia facts, we directly tested several theories of feedback-timing effects and also examined the effects of restudy and retest trials following immediate and delayed feedback. Results were not consistent with theories assuming that the only function of feedback is to correct initial errors but instead supported a theoretical account assuming that delaying feedback strengthens initially correct responses due to the spacing of encoding opportunities: Delaying feedback increased the probability of correct response perseveration on the final retention test but had minimal effects on error correction or error perseveration probabilities. In a 2nd experiment, the effects of varying the lags between study, test, and feedback trials during learning provided further support for the spacing hypothesis.

  abstract = {Being engaging, knowledgeable, and empathetic are all desirable general qualities in a conversational agent. Previous work has introduced tasks and datasets that aim to help agents to learn those qualities in isolation and gauge how well they can express them. But rather than being specialized in one single quality, a good open-domain conversational agent should be able to seamlessly blend them all into one cohesive conversational flow. In this work, we investigate several ways to combine models trained towards isolated capabilities, ranging from simple model aggregation schemes that require minimal additional training, to various forms of multi-task training that encompass several skills at all training stages. We further propose a new dataset, BlendedSkillTalk, to analyze how these capabilities would mesh together in a natural conversation, and compare the performance of different architectures and training schemes. Our experiments show that multi-tasking over several tasks that focus on particular capabilities results in better blended conversation performance compared to models trained on a single skill, and that both unified or two-stage approaches perform well if they are constructed to avoid unwanted bias in skill selection or are fine-tuned on our new task.},

A common understanding of what characterizes clinical skills and learning outcomes needs to be established. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a new reflection and feedback tool for formative assessment. The study has a descriptive quantitative design. 129 students participated who were at the end of the first year of a Bachelor degree in nursing. After highfidelity simulation, data were collected using a questionnaire with 19 closed-ended and 2 open-ended questions. The tool stimulated peer assessment, and enabled students to be more thorough in what to assess as an observer in clinical skills. The tool provided a structure for selfassessment and made visible items that are important to be aware of in clinical skills.  CONCLUSIONS  This article adds to simulation literature and provides a tool that is useful in enhancing peer learning, which is essential for nurses in practice. The tool has potential for enabling students to learn about reflection and developing skills for guiding others in practice after they have graduated.},

  abstract = {Technology-mediated learning (TML) is a major trend in education, since it allows to integrate the strengths of traditional- and IT-based learning activities. However, TML providers still struggle in identifying areas for improvement in their TML offerings. One reason for their struggles is inconsistencies in the literature regarding drivers of TML performance. Prior research suggests that these inconsistencies in TML literature might stem from neglecting the importance of considering the process perspective in addition to the input and outcome perspectives. This gap needs to be addressed to better understand the different drivers of the performance of TML scenarios. Filling this gap would further support TML providers with more precise guidance on how to (re-)design their offerings toward their customers' needs. To achieve our goal, we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and evaluate a holistic model for assessing TML performance. In particular, we consolidate the body of literature, followed by a focus group workshop and a Q-sorting exercise with TML practitioners, and an empirical pre-study to develop and initially test our research model. Afterward, we collect data from 161 participants of TML vocational software trainings and evaluate our holistic model for assessing TML performance. The results provide empirical evidence for the importance of the TML process quality dimension as suggested in prior literature and highlighted by our TML practitioners. Our main theoretical as well as practical contribution is a holistic model that provides comprehensive insights into which constructs and facets shape the performance of TML in vocational software trainings.},

A collection of 173 SMS exchanges for personal communication, spontaneously composed by participants, was gathered. Each exchange was photographed from the display of the participant's mobile phone and then analysed with the approach of conversation analysis. A questionnaire was also administered during the collection procedure. The analysis of the practices organizing the action sequence reveals that exchanges frequently lack openings and closures, show an effort towards reciprocation and use implicit or anticipated actions. Social presence seems then characterized by a sense of constant availability, symmetric commitment and shared understanding. It is concluded that the sequential structure of mediated communication may give insightful details on the nature of the social presence thereby constituted and may provide a criterion to compare different communication modes.},

  abstract = {Despite artificial intelligence (AI) having transformed major aspects of our society, less than a fraction of its potential has been explored, let alone deployed, for education. AI-powered learning can provide millions of learners with a highly personalized, active and practical learning experience, which is key to successful learning. This is especially relevant in the context of online learning platforms. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative head-to-head study on learning outcomes for two popular online learning platforms (n=199 participants): A MOOC platform following a traditional model delivering content using lecture videos and multiple-choice quizzes, and the Korbit learning platform providing a highly personalized, active and practical learning experience. We observe a huge and statistically significant increase in the learning outcomes, with students on the Korbit platform providing full feedback resulting in higher course completion rates and achieving learning gains 2 to 2.5 times higher than both students on the MOOC platform and students in a control group who don't receive personalized feedback on the Korbit platform. The results demonstrate the tremendous impact that can be achieved with a personalized, active learning AI-powered system. Making this technology and learning experience available to millions of learners around the world will represent a significant leap forward towards the democratization of education.  9 pages, 6 figures},

  abstract = {The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource.  It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical physics.  Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a QC.  To build a universal QC is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high-Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (three qubits) and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful QC (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC).  An introduction to QEC is provided. The evolution of the QC is restricted to a carefully chosen subspace of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this subspace. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times.  The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics and avenues for future research.},

If there are benefits, does it matter in teams both with and without formal supervisors, and what contextual conditions facilitate such seeking? These questions motivate the current research. Based on the theoretical differences between peers and supervisors as targets of feedback seeking, we adopt a cost-value perspective to examine whether task interdependence and psychological safety affect the seeking of feedback from peers in a team. We also assess whether such seeking creates value for the seeker him-/herself (by having a cross-source effect on the supervisor?s evaluations) and for the collective (by impacting the team?s creativity). We test these ideas in two studies. In a sample of 209 employee-supervisor dyads (Study 1), we find that employees seek more peer feedback when tasks are interdependent, especially when they perceive their working environment as psychologically safe, and that supervisors view employees who seek more peer feedback as better team contributors. Then, in a longitudinal sample of 88 self-managed MBA consulting teams (Study 2), we find that the average level of peer feedback seeking in a team enhances the team?s creativity. Our findings highlight the power of seeking feedback from peers as well as the context factors shaping it.},

  abstract = {Abstract             At the core of what defines us as humans is the concept of theory of mind: the ability to track other people's mental states. The recent development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has led to intense debate about the possibility that these models exhibit behaviour that is indistinguishable from human behaviour in theory of mind tasks. Here we compare human and LLM performance on a comprehensive battery of measurements that aim to measure different theory of mind abilities, from understanding false beliefs to interpreting indirect requests and recognizing irony and faux pas. We tested two families of LLMs (GPT and LLaMA2) repeatedly against these measures and compared their performance with those from a sample of 1,907 human participants. Across the battery of theory of mind tests, we found that GPT-4 models performed at, or even sometimes above, human levels at identifying indirect requests, false beliefs and misdirection, but struggled with detecting faux pas. Faux pas, however, was the only test where LLaMA2 outperformed humans. Follow-up manipulations of the belief likelihood revealed that the superiority of LLaMA2 was illusory, possibly reflecting a bias towards attributing ignorance. By contrast, the poor performance of GPT originated from a hyperconservative approach towards committing to conclusions rather than from a genuine failure of inference. These findings not only demonstrate that LLMs exhibit behaviour that is consistent with the outputs of mentalistic inference in humans but also highlight the importance of systematic testing to ensure a non-superficial comparison between human and artificial intelligences.},

  abstract = {A core educational goal is to produce self-directed lifelong learners who have acquired or are able to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for their future professional workplace in a networked world. Constructivist and socio-constructivist theories of learning and instruction recommend using collaborative learning scenarios in all kinds of educational contexts in order to attain this goal. Thus, (networked) collaborative learning receives increasing attention in Higher and Further Education. To empower students as self-regulated and collaborative learners peer assessment and peer feedback are increasingly applied in both networked and face-to-face collaborative learning environments. Thus, the conditions under which peer feedback is beneficial for students' learning are worth to be investigated in detail. While the efficiency of feedback content has received much attention in prior feedback research, students' feedback perceptions have been hardly studied. In addition, students' emotional state can mediate the impact of (peer) feedback on their performance. Yet, each kind of feedback has to be perceived and processed in a mindful way, that is, attended to, understood and interpreted, and finally transformed into a corrective action by the student before it can influence subsequent learning. Since up to now the issue of feedback perception has been a neglected area of feedback research, instruments for measuring feedback perceptions are lacking. The purpose of this paper is thus to describe the development and the structural validation of a feedback perception questionnaire which measures students' feedback perceptions in terms of fairness (FA), usefulness (US), acceptance (AC), willingness to improve (WI) and affect (AF). The sample consists of 1535 secondary education students. They received a scenario in which a fictional student received fictional peer feedback on a writing assignment and this feedback was Concise General (CGF) or Elaborated Specific (ESF). The students' were asked to rate their perception of the feedback as if they had received the feedback themselves. The analyses confirm the structural validity of the five scales. FA, US and AC constitute the joined second order component 'Perceived Adequacy of Feedback' (PAF), which in turn positively predicts willingness to improve (WI) and affect (AF). The scale reliabilities were good to excellent.},

  abstract = {Taking online courses has become a delivery mode of choice for many students. This collaborative study focuses on the impact of college readiness; technological resources, and course design on student success in an online introduction to computers distance education course within the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). The study included 8,255 KCTCS students enrolled in online (3,340 students) and in-person (4,925 students) sections of an entry-level computer literacy course (CIS100) in the fall 2010 semester. Recent statistics of student success in the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) show a higher number of students fail or withdraw from online courses than in-person courses. Enrollment in online courses in the Kentucky Community and Technology Community System (KCTCS) has increased from 1,336 to over 127,000 in just over 10 years, thus this issue of student failure and withdrawal in online courses must be addressed. This dissertation consists of three primary parts: (1) a technical report written by a three-person research team representing a synthesis of the collaborative research, (2) an individual research study focused on the impact of course design on student success in online classes, and (3) an individually written reflective essay exploring faculty development as a problem of practice. Following an introduction to the study, Chapter 2 describes three components that affect student success in online courses: college readiness, technological barriers, and course design. Chapter 3 describes an analysis of the impact of course design on success in this online course. Approved courses were analyzed for the presence or absence of twelve course design variables identified through best practices in literature. Students enrolled in courses demonstrating designs that included consistent and organized layout and used various communication and interaction tools had a higher chance of success. Chapter 4 is an essay that addresses faculty development as a problem of practice and further discusses the ways in which faculty can learn effective online pedagogy through professional development, by examining current practices nationally, statewide and locally. Finally, a conclusion of companion research is shared with reflections about research, the dissertation process, lessons learned, and application to practice.

To resolve this issue, the present study develops and verifies a moderated mediation model to explore the positive influence of supervisor developmental feedback on employee innovative behavior via creative self-efficacy, as well as the moderating role of a supervisor's organizational embodiment in this process. Analyses of the multi-time data from 375 employees indicate that supervisor developmental feedback is positively associated with employee innovative behavior via his/her creative self-efficacy. Moreover, a supervisor's organizational embodiment moderates the influence of supervisor developmental feedback on employee creative self-efficacy and the mediating role of creative self-efficacy. From these analyses, the present study not only further develops several views of pervious research in the field of supervisor feedback and employee innovation, but also provides a potential managerial way to promote employee innovative behavior from the perspective of supervisor feedback.},

This research posits that a user's mindful state when adopting a technology is a crucial factor that determines how the technology will fit the task context at the postadoption stage and, thus, has profound influence on user adoption and continued use of technology. Based on the mindfulness literature, we conceive of a new concept (mindfulness of technology adoption (MTA)) as a multi-faceted reflective high-order factor. We develop a MTA-TTF (task-technology fit) framework and integrate it into the cognitive change model to develop a research model that delineates the mechanisms through which MTA influences user adoption and continued use of technology. We examined the model via a longitudinal study of students' use of wiki systems. The results suggest that mindful adopters will more likely perceive a technology as useful and choose a technology that turns out to fit their tasks. Hence, mindful adopters are likely to have high disconfirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction at the post-adoption stage. The findings have significant implications for IS research and practices.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) can achieve highly effective performance on various reasoning tasks by incorporating step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting as demonstrations. However, the reasoning chains of demonstrations generated by LLMs are prone to errors, which can subsequently lead to incorrect reasoning during inference. Furthermore, inappropriate exemplars (overly simplistic or complex), can affect overall performance among varying levels of difficulty. We introduce Iter-CoT (Iterative bootstrapping in Chain-of-Thoughts Prompting), an iterative bootstrapping approach for selecting exemplars and generating reasoning chains. By utilizing iterative bootstrapping, our approach enables LLMs to autonomously rectify errors, resulting in more precise and comprehensive reasoning chains. Simultaneously, our approach selects challenging yet answerable questions accompanied by reasoning chains as exemplars with a moderate level of difficulty, which enhances the LLMs' generalizability across varying levels of difficulty. Experimental results indicate that Iter-CoT exhibits superiority, achieving competitive performance across three distinct reasoning tasks on ten datasets.  28 pages, 10 figures, 21 tables},

Combining 104 contrasts of conditions of reading texts with and without feedback, including 6,124 participants, using the random effects model resulted in a positive effect of feedback on learning from text (g+~=~0.35). Moderator analyses showed that feedback is particularly effective if provided directly after reading, but less so when provided during reading. If feedback is provided directly after reading, elaborate feedback and knowledge-of-correct-response feedback were more effective than knowledge-of-response feedback. If feedback is provided during reading, no differences are found between the effects of different types of feedback. Additionally, computer-delivered feedback is more beneficial for learning from text than non-computer-delivered feedback. Implications for optimizing conditions to support learning from text are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study explored the contribution of peer-assisted learning (PAL) in the development of evaluative judgement capacity; the ability to understand work quality and apply those standards to appraising performance. The study employed a mixed methods approach, collecting self-reported survey data, observations of, and reflective interviews with, the medical students observed. Participants were in their first year of clinical placements. Data were thematically analysed. Students indicated that PAL contributed to both the comprehension of notions of quality, and the practice of making comparisons between a given performance and the standards. Emergent themes included peer story-telling, direct observation of performance, and peer-based feedback, all of which helped students to define 'work quality'. By participating in PAL, students were required to make comparisons, therefore using the standards of practice and gaining a deeper understanding of them. The data revealed tensions in that peers were seen as less threatening than supervisors with the advantage of increasing learners' appetites for thoughtful 'intellectual risk taking'. Despite this reported advantage of peer engagement, learners still expressed a preference for feedback from senior teachers as more trusted sources of clinical knowledge. While this study suggests that PAL already contributes to the development of evaluative judgement, further steps could be taken to formalise PAL in clinical placements to improve learners' capacity to make accurate judgements on the performance of self and others. Further experimental studies are necessary to confirm the best methods of using PAL to develop evaluative judgement. This may include both students and educators as instigators of PAL in the workplace.},

This paper also investigates various models of measuring quality in higher education, consider their value and discuss both their shortcomings and contributions to the assessment of higher education institutions. These models include the simple 'production model', which depicts a direct relationship between inputs and outputs; the 'value-added approach', which measures the gain by students before and after they receive higher education; and the 'total quality experience approach', which aims to capture the entire learning experience undergone by students during their years in universities or colleges.},

Results provide initial evidence for the validity and utility of text mining and demonstrate that the linguistic indicators generated by text analysis are predictive of eWOM communicators' attitudes toward a product or service. Text analysis indicators (e.g., Negations and Money) can explain additional variance in eWOM communicators' attitudes above and beyond the star ratings and may become a promising supplement to the widely used star ratings as indicators of eWOM valence.},

An extension of past findings indicated a "contrast effect" - that is, shifts in reinforcement which were inconsistent with prior established expectations produced exaggerated behaviors. This happened in the Non-Withdrawal condition, and only partially in the Withdrawal condition.

The course development process, including a benchmark study and focus group with marketing professionals, is discussed, and survey results assessing students' reactions to the course are presented. Suggestions for successfully implementing a similar course and useful references are also provided. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is filled with hype and inflated expectations. Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the significant benefit of society.},

  abstract = {Background: Distraction is a functional emotion regulation strategy utilized to relieve emotional distress. Within the attention economy perspective, distraction is increasingly associated with digital technology use, performance impairments and interference with higher-order cognitive processes. Research on smartphone distraction and its association with problematic smartphone use is still scarce and there is no available psychometric assessment tool to assess this cognitive and emotive process parsimoniously. Method: The present study reports the development and evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS) through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, construct validity, gender invariance, and latent mean differences. The study was conducted in a sample of British university students (N = 1,001; M = 21.10 years, SD = 2.77). Results: The 16-item SDS was best conceptualized in a four-factor model solution comprising attention impulsiveness, online vigilance, emotion regulation, and multitasking. Construct validity was established using relevant psychosocial and mental health measures, with SDS scores being moderately associated with deficient self-regulation and problematic social media use. Gender measurement invariance was achieved at the configural, metric, and scalar levels, and latent mean differences indicated that females had significantly higher means than males across all four SDS latent factors. Discussion: The SDS presents with several strengths, including its theoretical grounding, relatively short length, and sound psychometric properties. The SDS enables the assessment of distraction, which appears to be one of the pathways to problematic smartphone use facilitating overuse and overreliance on smartphones for emotion regulation processes. The assessment of distraction in relation to problematic use in vulnerable populations may facilitate interventions that could encourage metacognition and benefit these groups by allowing sustained productivity in an increasingly disrupted work and social environment.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (Gen.AI) is capable of significantly improving the breadth and depth of structured literature reviews (SLRs). However, its inclusion raises essential questions regarding the review's methodology, quality, and ethical implications. Previous research predominantly focused on the capabilities and limitations of Gen.AI to establish guidelines for research practices. However, the rapid evolution of Gen.AI often outpaces the publication of methodological papers. In response, our study adopts a criteria-centric approach, scrutinizing the scientific quality standards that Gen.AI must meet. In other words, instead of discussing what Gen.AI can and cannot do, we discuss what we should allow Gen.AI to do, irrespective of its capabilities. Our study informs researchers in the art and science of SLRs. First, we analyze the established state-of-the-art processes and associated quality standards in SLRs. From this, we synthesize a unified process and criterion set, not only underpinning a comprehensive understanding of the extant SLR methodologies but also serving as the foundational framework for integrating Gen.AI. Second, we delineate the specific scenarios conducive to incorporating Gen.AI into this fundamental framework, as well as situations where its integration may not be suitable. Our contribution is further solidified by providing a detailed, step-by-step guide---akin to a ``cooking recipe''---to effectively integrate Gen.AI in SLRs, ensuring adherence to established quality criteria.},

This article focuses on how to make informed choices-by separating signal from noise-when evaluating emerging technologies. It identifies three non-obvious sources of noise that distort the disruptive potential of an emerging technology, and describes three frameworks for assessing the potential disruptiveness of an emerging technology.

Participants took a computer-adaptive test in which 2 features, difficulty of the initial item and difficulty of subsequent items, were manipulated, then responded to questionnaires assessing their reactions to the test. The data show that the relationship between a test's objective difficulty, which was determined by the 2 manipulated test characteristics, and reactions was fully mediated by perceived performance. Additional analyses evaluated the impact of feedback on reactions to the adaptive test. In general, feedback that was consistent with perceptions of performance was positively related to reactions. The results suggest that minor changes to the design of an adaptive test may potentially enhance examinees' reactions.},

  abstract = {This guide is intended for teachers who want to learn more about educational design of college courses. Chapter 1 identifies various pressures for change in designing courses and urges creation of conditions that foster deep learning. Chapter 2 examines various models of the course design process. Chapter 3 discusses beliefs, values and ideologies in course design, such as the traditional or discipline-based approach, the performance or systems-based approach, and the socially critical approach. Chapter 4 suggests research techniques for gathering information to make decisions about course goals and content. Chapter 5 discusses various course structures, including structure based on the logic of the subject matter; performance-, role-, and competence-based structures; project-, inquiry- or problem-based structures; and structure based on key (overarching) concepts, themes, or intellectual abilities. Chapter 6 considers ways to make learning opportunities more flexible, such as flexible entry and exit, alternative entry routes, and flexible delivery. Chapter 7 offers guidelines for formulating goals and objectives for units of study; and Chapter 8 discusses the variety of possible teaching strategies in the context of a five-step model of learning. Chapter 9 describes and compares various assessment approaches. The final chapter, Chapter 10, offers guidance for implementing the new course. (Contains approximately 150 references.) (DB)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES  The aim of this review was to explore how nurse education prepares students to participate in the peer review process and to deal with the benefits and challenges of giving and receiving peer feedback.  DESIGN  Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) five-step strategy for integrated literature reviews served as a framework for this analysis.  DATA SOURCES  Relevant online university databases (CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, etc.) were searched using a combination of keywords, yielding 24 studies from peer-reviewed journals between 1988 and 2018 that fit inclusion criteria after initial screening.  REVIEW METHODS  Data were organized in a summary table by author, year, title, country, methodology, student level, sample size, and setting. Qualitative data analysis software facilitated identification of themes and systematic coding of content. The data were compared across the didactic, clinical, and laboratory settings and then analyzed and synthesized globally for general conclusions.  RESULTS  The predominant themes that emerged were benefits and challenges of peer assessment in nurse education, strategies to prepare students to provide supportive feedback, anonymous vs. non-anonymous peer assessment practices, and recommendations for instructional strategies related to peer assessment.  CONCLUSIONS  Peer assessment provides multiple sources of feedback, guides students to think critically about course content, and engages them in advanced self-assessment. However, if students are not well prepared to participate in peer assessment, it can lead to a sense of incompetence, anxiety, and a hostile learning environment. Well-designed peer assessment is an important instructional strategy to prepare future nurses to participate in peer review in professional nursing practice.},

Each of these groups has a vested interest in the success of the educational process. While having definite, but varying ideas about their "ideal" course, students (as a group) do not always make rational, logical decisions. Students typically have only a limited opportunity (usually through course evaluations) to give their opinions about the courses they take. Meanwhile, potential employers also have certain expectations regarding the quality of the students' skills, talents, and prior education. Some of these expectations can be reflected in the academic courses that students have taken and the rigor and/or variety of student talents developed during their academic training. One thing these two groups share is a lack of direct input into course design. It is not surprising that faculty generally believe that course design is a task for the faculty - as it should be. However, many academics teach the danger of decisions made in isolation from external factors. The purpose of this paper is to present the preferences of these two groups with respect to controllable course design features resulting from survey data from business students and potential employers. The analysis is intended to provide input for faculty with respect to course design. The utilization of this information has the potential to improve student satisfaction and align courses more closely with employer needs, while maintaining the academic integrity of the course and the academic freedom of the faculty.},

  abstract = {The rapid advances of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are revolutionizing data science and statistics. These state-of-the-art tools can streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education. Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology, integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it. Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends, potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift, hoping to spark further discourse and investigation into this exciting, uncharted territory.},

The formative research method was used in the study, and two project teams' processes of putting courses, which were being taught in classrooms at the time, on the Web were examined in depth to reveal and confirm the components of the design model. The participants were 13 instructional designers. In addition to the logbooks kept by the designers, individual and focus group interview techniques were employed in the data-gathering process. Two researchers analyzed the data concurrently using content analysis. The logbooks and the focus-group interviews were used for model formation, and the individual interviews to confirm the components of the model. Based on the findings from the two design cases, the experience-based e-course design model consisting of seven basic stages including forming design team, preliminary search, analysis, instructional and technical design, integration, tests, and improvements was proposed. It is considered that sustaining Web-based course design efforts within this model will enable both implementing the design process more effectively, and the Web-based course obtained at the end of the process to have higher quality.},

We link these problems to contradictions between underlying assumptions about data as a commodity whose reuse is not compromised when it is extracted from the context in which it has been captured, and the reality of data as entangled with, and constituted through, local practice. To illustrate these problems, we draw on the experiences of a number of HealthGrid projects developing infrastructures for data sharing and reuse, and trace the strategies that have evolved to address them. These experiences problematize the "one size fits all" model initially adopted by HealthGrids, and highlight the need for design and development strategies that are able to engage with local needs and thereby ensure that the technical infrastructure is properly aligned with the human infrastructure it is supposed to support.

It includes several additions and updates, e.g. on inductive mining techniques, the notion of alignments, a considerably expanded section on software tools and a completely new chapter of process mining in the large. It is self-contained, while at the same time covering the entire process-mining spectrum from process discovery to predictive analytics. After a general introduction to data science and process mining in Part I, Part II provides the basics of business process modeling and data mining necessary to understand the remainder of the book. Next, Part III focuses on process discovery as the most important process mining task, while Part IV moves beyond discovering the control flow of processes, highlighting conformance checking, and organizational and time perspectives. Part V offers a guide to successfully applying process mining in practice, including an introduction to the widely used open-source tool ProM and several commercial products. Lastly, Part VI takes a step back, reflecting on the material presented and the key open challenges. Overall, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in process mining. It is intended for business process analysts, business consultants, process managers, graduate students, and BPM researchers.},

In analysing the results, a distinction is made between lower-order and higherorder learning. What little high-quality research is available suggests that students could benefit from knowledge of correct response (KCR) to obtain lower-order learning outcomes. As well, elaborated feedback (EF) seems beneficial for gaining both lower-order and higher-order learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study shows that a number of variables should be taken into account when investigating the effects of feedback on learning outcomes. Implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the position of employees in the organizational hierarchy is important in explaining their feedback seeking behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a social network perspective by using an ego-centric network survey to investigate employees' feedback seeking behaviour within their professional networks. Data were collected from an online questionnaire among 243 employees working in a large multinational organization located in The Netherlands. Findings: Results indicate that employees frequently seek feedback from colleagues within the same department. However, managers or leaders seek significantly less feedback from colleagues in the same department and from coaches, as compared to others. Furthermore, employees perceive the feedback they receive from managers/leaders, coaches, and colleagues in the same department as useful. Originality/value: The study findings extend the existing literature on the dynamics of feedback seeking of employees across different hierarchical levels. Methodologically, an egocentric network survey was used to investigate the employees' relationships within their professional network. The findings suggest that this approach, novel in research on feedback seeking, is valuable and promising. (Contains 2 tables.)}

  abstract = {This article presents the implementation of the constructive alignment theory (CAT) in a power system analysis course through a consensus-based course design process. The consensus-based design process involves both the instructor and graduate-level students and it aims to develop the CAT framework in a holistic manner with the goal of including different perceptions. The considerations required to implement this approach are described in detail. To examine the effect of this approach, three different course evaluations were conducted by querying the students during different stages of the course. These evaluations show that most of the students find a benefit for their learning in the implementation of CAT within the new course design. These observations are supported by a comparison of the students' performance in the new course and the previous one. Finally, the revised two-factor study process questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) is utilised to identify the students' learning approach towards the course. The aim is to correlate the students' approach with their final grade to assess if students adopting a deep learning approach are rewarded with higher marks and vice versa, that is, to check if the CAT implementation was successful. Meanwhile, some of the R-SPQ-2F limitations, which affect the quality of the results, are identified and discussed. Additionally, to facilitate the practical usage of R-SPQ-2F, an algorithm was developed by the authors to rank the students' approach towards the course. The results of the new ranking algorithm demonstrate positive correlation with the students' final grade, which is an indication of the effective CAT implementation.

In this sense, recommender systems may be deleterious to notions of human autonomy. Many ethical systems point to respect for human autonomy as a key principle arising from human rights considerations, and several emerging frameworks for AI include this principle. Yet, no specific formalization has been defined. Separately, self-determination theory shows that autonomy is an innate psychological need for people, and moreover has a significant body of experimental work that formalizes and measures level of human autonomy. In this position paper, we argue that there is a need to specifically operationalize respect for human autonomy in the context of recommender systems. Moreover, that such an operational definition can be developed based on well-established approaches from experimental psychology, which can then be used to design future recommender systems that respect human autonomy.  2 page position paper presented at 3rd FAccTRec Workshop on Responsible Recommendation (RecSys 2020 Workshop)},

  abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing organizational interest and investment in virtual worlds (VWs), there is a lack of research on the benefits of VWs. When and how does the use of VW systems engender better organizational outcomes than traditional collaborative technologies? This paper investigates the value of VWs for team collaboration. Team collaboration is particularly relevant in studying VWs given the rich interactive nature of VWs and an increasing organizational reliance on virtual teamwork. To understand the value of VW use for team collaboration, we examine the relationship between a team's disposition toward IT, their general disposition (personality) and VW use in influencing team cohesion and performance. We conducted a field study that compares two collaborative technology systems - one that is based on a traditional desktop metaphor and one that is grounded in the principles of a virtual world. We tracked the use of the systems for one year. We analyzed data at the team level and the results generally support our model, with agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and computer self-efficacy interacting with time and technology type to positively influence team technology use. We also found that the use of the virtual world system positively influenced the relationship between technology use and team cohesion, which, in turn, predicts team performance.

  abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems (IS) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the IS literature on UTAUT from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of UTAUT and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber's (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined UTAUT and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to UTAUT, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of UTAUT using Whetten's (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: 1) synthesize the existing UTAUT extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and 2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future UTAUT-related research using the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Conversational modeling is an important task in natural language understanding and machine intelligence. Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.},

We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

  abstract = {Review papers provide a foundation for knowledge development in information systems (IS) as well as in any other scientific discipline. While some of the prominent reviews in information systems are cited more than twice a day on average, others take years to accumulate single digit citations. The magnitude of these differences and the proliferation of review papers in recent years prompt us to empirically analyze what distinguishes those reviews that have proven to be integral to scientific progress from those that might not be considered impactful. Our results demonstrate that the attributes explaining scientific impact are unique for the different types of reviews: reviews for describing, understanding, explaining, and theory testing. Transparency of the applied methodology is important for reviews that target theory testing, understanding, or explaining; similarly, reviews for describing, understanding or explaining achieve a higher impact when they develop a research agenda. By providing nuanced insights into the attributes of review papers that are valued by subsequent research, our study contributes to the vibrant discourse on literature reviews in IS. We thereby inform the different stakeholders involved in the development and publication of review papers in the IS field.},

  abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly utilized to provide adaptivity in educational applications. However, recent research has highlighted a variety of biases in pre-trained language models. While existing studies investigate bias in different domains, they are limited in addressing fine-grained analysis on educational and multilingual corpora. In this work, we analyze bias across text and through multiple architectures on a corpus of 9,165 German peer-reviews collected from university students over five years. Notably, our corpus includes labels such as helpfulness, quality, and critical aspect ratings from the peer-review recipient as well as demographic attributes. We conduct a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) analysis on (1) our collected corpus in connection with the clustered labels, (2) the most common pre-trained German language models (T5, BERT, and GPT-2) and GloVe embeddings, and (3) the language models after fine-tuning on our collected data-set. In contrast to our initial expectations, we found that our collected corpus does not reveal many biases in the co-occurrence analysis or in the GloVe embeddings. However, the pre-trained German language models find substantial conceptual, racial, and gender bias and have significant changes in bias across conceptual and racial axes during fine-tuning on the peer-review data. With our research, we aim to contribute to the fourth UN sustainability goal (quality education) with a novel dataset, an understanding of biases in natural language education data, and the potential harms of not counteracting biases in language models for educational tasks.},

Despite their potential, LLMs are known to harbor inherent biases which may negatively impact learners. Previous studies have investigated bias in models and data representations separately, neglecting the potential impact of LLM bias on human writing. In this paper, we investigate how bias transfers through an AI writing support pipeline. We conduct a large-scale user study with 231 students writing business case peer reviews in German. Students are divided into five groups with different levels of writing support: one classroom group with feature-based suggestions and four groups recruited from Prolific -- a control group with no assistance, two groups with suggestions from fine-tuned GPT-2 and GPT-3 models, and one group with suggestions from pre-trained GPT-3.5. Using GenBit gender bias analysis, Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT), and Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) we evaluate the gender bias at various stages of the pipeline: in model embeddings, in suggestions generated by the models, and in reviews written by students. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in gender bias between the resulting peer reviews of groups with and without LLM suggestions. Our research is therefore optimistic about the use of AI writing support in the classroom, showcasing a context where bias in LLMs does not transfer to students' responses.

A new categorization of self-regulated learning strategies, that is, personal versus social learning strategies, is proposed, and measurement scales are developed. The new measures were tested using data collected from employees in a large company. Our approach provides context-relevant insights into online training providers and employees themselves. The results suggest that learners adopt different self-regulated learning strategies resulting in different e-learning outcomes. Furthermore, the use of self-regulated learning strategies is influenced by individual factors such as virtual competence and goal orientation, and job and contextual factors such as intellectual demand and cooperative norms. The findings can (1) help e-learners obtain better learning outcomes through their active use of varied learning strategies, (2) provide useful information for organizations that are currently using or plan to use e-learning for training, and (3) inform software designers to integrate self-regulated learning strategy support in e-learning system design and development.

  abstract = {Delivering negative performance feedback is inevitable in the workplace. However, recipients may feel uncomfortable and behave defensively, and may be unwilling to accept negative feedback mainly because they fear losing face. Such unproductive responses are heightened when negative feedback is delivered through computer-mediated communication (CMC) channels in which many nonverbal cues in face-to-face communication cannot be used to alleviate the concerns of losing face. This study examines the effectiveness of emoticons, which are designed as surrogates for facial expressions in CMC environments, in conveying social and emotional signals of the feedback provider. Specifically, based on the feedback process model and the dissonance reduction theory, this study investigates the differing effects of two types of emoticons (i.e., liking and disliking ones) on the acceptance of negative feedback by considering feedback specificity as a contingent factor. Our results suggest that using liking emoticons increases perceived good intention of the feedback provider and decreases perceived feedback negativity when the feedback is specific; however, it has no significant effect for unspecific feedback. By contrast, our results suggest that using disliking emoticons decreases perceived good intention of the feedback provider and increases perceived feedback negativity when the feedback is unspecific, whereas such effects are not significant for specific feedback. In turn, both perceived good intention of the feedback provider and perceived feedback negativity affect acceptance of the negative feedback.},

The workforce is aging and becoming increasingly age-diverse, suggesting that organizational researchers and practitioners need to better understand how age differences may manifest in the workplace and the implications for human resource practice. Integrating socioemotional selectivity theory with the performance feedback literature and using a time-lagged design, the current study examined age differences in moderating the relationships between the characteristics of performance feedback and employee reactions to the feedback event. The results suggest that older workers had higher levels of feedback orientation on social awareness, but lower levels of feedback orientation on utility than younger workers. Furthermore, the positive associations between favorability of feedback and feedback delivery and feedback reactions were stronger for older workers than for younger workers, whereas the positive association between feedback quality and feedback reactions was stronger for younger workers than for older workers. Finally, the current study revealed that age-related differences in employee feedback orientation could explain the different patterns of relationships between feedback characteristics and feedback reactions across older and younger workers. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications for building theory about workplace aging and improving ways that performance feedback is managed across employees from diverse age groups.},

In this paper, we propose a new decoding strategy, self-consistency, to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It first samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths. Self-consistency leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with a striking margin on a range of popular arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K (+17.9\%), SVAMP (+11.0\%), AQuA (+12.2\%), StrategyQA (+6.4\%) and ARC-challenge (+3.9\%).

  abstract = {Human intelligence thrives on the concept of cognitive synergy, where collaboration and information integration among different cognitive processes yield superior outcomes compared to individual cognitive processes in isolation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance as general task-solving agents, they still struggle with tasks that require intensive domain knowledge and complex reasoning. In this work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist refers to an intelligent agent that collaborates with multiple minds, combining their individual strengths and knowledge, to enhance problem-solving and overall performance in complex tasks. By dynamically identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. We have discovered that assigning multiple, fine-grained personas in LLMs elicits better problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of personas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing, Codenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing both knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, such as Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs, SPP effectively elicits internal knowledge acquisition abilities, reduces hallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities.

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are increasing in capability and popularity, propelling their application in new domains -- including as replacements for human participants in computational social science, user testing, annotation tasks, and more. Traditionally, in all of these settings survey distributors are careful to find representative samples of the human population to ensure the validity of their results and understand potential demographic differences. This means in order to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (i.e., relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are doomed to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, then empirically show this to be true on 4 LLMs through a series of human studies with 3200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third consideration about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each of these limitations to a pernicious history that shows why each is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases where LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the goal is to supplement rather than replace (e.g., pilot studies), we provide empirically-better inference-time techniques to reduce, but not remove, these harms.},

  author = {Ward, Steven Jerome},
  year = {2012},
  journal = {ProQuest LLC},
  abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the course design decisions and pedagogical practices of American literature teachers at three rural community colleges of varying size in North Alabama. Fink's (2003) Integrated Course Design (ICD) model provided a framework for this study, and the researcher attempted to determine if and to what degree rural community college American literature instructors reflect the over-arching qualities and components of Fink's ICD model. The participants in this study were ten full-time community college American literature instructors of varying ages, educational backgrounds, and years of teaching experience; the participant group included five male and five female instructors. Data for the study were derived from interviews with each instructor, classroom observations, and review of course-related documents. Using basic qualitative methods, the researcher conducted a thematic analysis of the data, which enabled him to organize the qualitative data into manageable strands. Using the study's theoretical framework as a basis for coding the data, the researcher was able to establish connections between the collected data and the research questions. Four themes emerged from data analysis: (a) Situational Factors Affect Course Design and Instructional Decisions; (b) Academically Unprepared Students Affect Course Design and Instructional Decisions; (c) Instruction Should Be Engaging and the Subject Matter Should Be Relevant to Students' Lives; and (d) American Literature Instructors Should Be Reflective Practitioners. The researcher found that participants did consider certain situational factors as they planned for and delivered their courses. Also, the data proved that instructors gave little consideration to the learning goals as they planned and delivered their courses. Similarly, the researcher discovered that participants did not plan teaching and learning activities in advance, nor did they work to ensure alignment with the learning goals or assessments. Finally, findings suggest that the participants spent little time planning or working to ensure the integration of Fink's (2003) four components of course design; when it occurred, integration happened inadvertently. The participants' course design decisions and pedagogical practices only partially reflect the tenets of Fink's Integrated Course Design Model.

Aspects of eudaimonic well-being assessed by the QEWB include self-discovery, perceived development of one's best potentials, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, intense involvement in activities, investment of significant effort, and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive. The QEWB was administered to two large, ethnically diverse samples of college students drawn from multiple sites across the United States. A three-part evaluation of the instrument was conducted: (1) evaluating psychometric properties, (2) comparing QEWB scores across gender, age, ethnicity, family income, and family structure, and (3) assessing the convergent, discriminant, construct, and incremental validity of the QEWB. Six hypotheses relating QEWB scores to identity formation, personality traits, and positive and negative psychological functioning were evaluated. The internal consistency of the scale was high and results of independent CFAs indicated that the QEWB items patterned onto a common factor. The distribution of scores approximated a normal curve. Demographic variables were found to predict only small proportions of QEWB score variability. Support for the hypotheses tested provides evidence for the validity of the QEWB as an instrument for assessing eudaimonic well-being. Implications for theory and future research directions are discussed.},

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall).  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can outperform crowdsourced human annotators - on a set of {\textasciitilde}16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72\% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76\% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.},

This is likely to serve a number of different functions, which are currently poorly understood. In this article, we present two systems, ScriptLog+ TimeLine and EyeWrite, that adopt different and complementary approaches to exploring this activity by collecting and analyzing combined eye movement and keystroke data from writers composing extended texts. ScriptLog+ TimeLine is a system that is based on an existing keystroke-logging program and uses heuristic, pattern-matching methods to identify reading episodes within eye movement data. EyeWrite is an integrated editor and analysis system that permits identification of the words that the writer fixates and their location within the developing text. We demonstrate how the methods instantiated within these systems can be used to make sense of the large amount of data generated by eyetracking and keystroke logging in order to inform understanding of the cognitive processes that underlie written text production.},

I quickly realized I had almost no knowledge of the published scholarship on this subject. From my reading of this literature, I found the research on the predictors of student learning particularly informative. In particular, I gained an appreciation for the impact of course design. In this article, I summarize a framework for designing "significant learning experiences." In discussing the three key components of course design (learning outcomes, learning activities, and learning assessments), I offer tips and give examples relevant for the field of management. My intent is to share the most important information I have learned from a decade of conversations with experts on student learning-the things I wish someone had taught me 30 years ago.

Word selection for the revision privileged natural language, and the matching rate of the Dictionary, which includes 8,742 words, was increased to 90\%. Dictionary scores were available for 9 of every 10 words in most language samples. A third rated dimension (Imagery) was added, and normative scores were obtained for natural English. Evidence supports the reliability and validity of ratings. Two sample applications to very disparate instances of natural language are described. The revised Dictionary, which contains ratings for words characteristic of natural language, is a portable tool that can be applied in almost any situation involving language.},

A purposeful sample of 424 pre-service teacher candidates enrolled in an Instructional Technology course were administered the "Technology and Teaching Efficacy Scale" at the beginning and end of the semester to assess perceived confidence in his or her abilities to implement technology into classroom lessons/activities to promote students' success through the use of technology. Findings suggest that preservice teacher candidates, who participated in a technology course that was designed to develop confidence in the use and implementation of technology had an impact on use of technology and teaching self-efficacy.},

In the process, they experience first-hand what it is like to participate in a hybrid course. The Spring Seminar offers a potential model for other institutions to use in assisting faculty as they transform traditional courses into hybrid courses. By reviewing the content, design, and delivery of the Spring Seminar, participants will gain insights into a model for addressing faculty's inexperience with the course-design process and with hybrid courses. They will also explore the methods by which faculty are engaged in a concentrated, immersive experience aimed at acquainting them-from a student's perspective-with the challenges and benefits of hybrid courses.}

Overall results based on a random-effects model indicate a medium effect (d = 0.48) of feedback on student learning, but the significant heterogeneity in the data shows that feedback cannot be understood as a single consistent form of treatment. A moderator analysis revealed that the impact is substantially influenced by the information content conveyed. Furthermore, feedback has higher impact on cognitive and motor skills outcomes than on motivational and behavioral outcomes. We discuss these findings in the light of the assumptions made in The power of feedback (Hattie and Timperley, 2007). In general, the results suggest that feedback has rightly become a focus of teaching research and practice. However, they also point toward the necessity of interpreting different forms of feedback as independent measures.},

However, findings from a century of work in psychology, psychopharmacology, and neuroscience converge on the notion that such procedures may pertain mainly to forgetting in the laboratory and that everyday forgetting is attributable to an altogether different form of interference. According to this idea, recently formed memories that have not yet had a chance to consolidate are vulnerable to the interfering force of mental activity and memory formation (even if the interfering activity is not similar to the previously learned material). This account helps to explain why sleep, alcohol, and benzodiazepines all improve memory for a recently learned list, and it is consistent with recent work on the variables that affect the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.},

These officers represent local, regional, and super-regional financial institutions. The course content was organized to better prepare finance and economic students for careers in banking. The program uses active learning processes to develop critical thinking while acquiring skills specific to a given career. The first course is taught in a traditional lecture format and serves as a prerequisite for the other courses. The second course is experiential in nature; class meetings are held in different bank offices and are led by an officer from that bank. The class meetings have predetermined topics and the banker leading the class is expected to discuss not only theory but application and examples drawn from personal experience. The second course also models real-world experience through the use of a bank simulation in which students groups direct their own bank in competition with other students. The final course in the sequence is a formal summer internship modeled after the employee training programs that each bank provides its own employees. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The purpose of this mixed methods study was to examine the academic achievement implications for developmental community college students taking an introductory business course when instruction was differentiated in order to make course content more accessible. The research questions guiding this study looked at the relationship between differentiated instructional strategies and traditional instructional strategies. The theoretical framework for the study focused on instructional practices that target postsecondary education and are designed to facilitate student learning. The quantitative data results indicate there is no statistically significant relationship between student academic performance and the instructional method used. The qualitative data suggests students may have been more engaged when differentiated instructional strategies were used. The instructor participating in the study gained an understanding that student learning needs to be at the forefront of the course planning process. These results have particular meaning for student learning when considering that many community colleges allow students who have tested into developmental course work to take college-credit or gateway college courses. Implications for future research are in the areas of professional development for community college faculty and the way institutions approach developmental and remedial education.

  abstract = {Abstract             Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta-analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta-analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta-analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human-like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence.

  abstract = {It is a notable trend to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, e.g., tasks that require a sequence of actions and dynamic interaction with tools and external environments. In this paper, we propose StateFlow, a novel LLM-based task-solving paradigm that conceptualizes complex task-solving processes as state machines. In StateFlow, we distinguish between "process grounding" (via state and state transitions) and "sub-task solving" (through actions within a state), enhancing control and interpretability of the task-solving procedure. A state represents the status of a running process. The transitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made by the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression. Upon entering a state, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided by different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed. Our results show that StateFlow significantly enhances LLMs' efficiency. For instance, StateFlow achieves 13\% and 28\% higher success rates compared to ReAct in InterCode SQL and ALFWorld benchmark, with 5x and 3x less cost respectively. We also show that StateFlow can be combined with iterative refining methods like Reflexion to further improve performance.},

On the transfer test 1 day later which required producing novel absolute movement times, the better group demonstrated more effective learning than the worse group.

Metaverse (i.e. extended reality: XR) enables novel forms of engrossing telepresence,~but it also~may make mundate tasks more effortless. Such technologies increasingly facilitate our work, education, healthcare, consumption and entertainment; however, at the same time, metaverse bring a host of challenges. Therefore, we pose the question whether XR technologies, specifically Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), either increase or decrease the difficulties of carrying out everyday tasks. In the current study we conducted a 2 (AR: with vs. without) {\texttimes} 2 (VR: with vs. without) between-subject experiment where participants faced a shopping-related task (including navigating, movement, hand-interaction, information processing, information searching, storing, decision making, and~simple calculation) to examine a proposed series of hypotheses. The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was used to measure subjective workload when using an XR-mediated information system including six sub-dimensions of frustration, performance, effort, physical, mental, and temporal demand. The findings indicate that AR was significantly associated with overall workload, especially mental demand and effort, while VR had no significant effect on any workload sub-dimensions. There was a significant interaction effect between AR and VR on physical demand, effort, and overall workload. The results imply that the resources and cost of operating XR-mediated realities are different and higher than physical reality.},

But what ways are there to check that they do? We attempt to automate the process of deciding whether a review comment detects a problem. We use over 18,000 review comments that were labeled by the reviewees as either detecting or not detecting a problem with the work. We deploy several traditional machine-learning models, as well as neural-network models using GloVe and BERT embeddings. We find that the best performer is the Hierarchical Attention Network classifier, followed by the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) Attention and Capsule model with scores of 93.1\% and 90.5\% respectively. The best non-neural network model was the support vector machine with a score of 89.71\%. This is followed by the Stochastic Gradient Descent model and the Logistic Regression model with 89.70\% and 88.98\%.},

However, one core problem with peer review of writing is that potentially useful feedbback from peers is not always presented in ways that lead to revision. Our prior investigations found that whether students implement feedback is significantly correlated with two feedback features: localization information and concrete solutions. But focusing on feedback features is time-intensive for researchers and instructors. We apply data mining and Natural Languagee Processing techniques to automatically code reviews for these feedback features. Our results show that it is feasible to provide intelligent suppport to peer review systems to automatically assess students' reviewing performance with respect to problem localization and solution. We also show that similar research conclusions about helpfulness perceptions of feedback across students and different expert types can be drawn from automatically coded data and from hand-coded data. {\copyright} Earli.},

  abstract = {Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8\% on GSM8K, and by up to 50\% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.}

  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

  abstract = {With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, researchers have discovered the potential of Chain-of-thought (CoT) to assist LLMs in accomplishing complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate steps. However, human thought processes are often non-linear, rather than simply sequential chains of thoughts. Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as a graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as edges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and allows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. Similar to Multimodal-CoT, we modeled GoT reasoning as a two-stage framework, generating rationales first and then producing the final answer. Specifically, we employ an additional graph-of-thoughts encoder for GoT representation learning and fuse the GoT representation with the original input representation through a gated fusion mechanism. We implement a GoT reasoning model on the T5 pre-trained model and evaluate its performance on a text-only reasoning task (GSM8K) and a multimodal reasoning task (ScienceQA). Our model achieves significant improvement over the strong CoT baseline with 3.41\% and 5.08\% on the GSM8K test set with T5-base and T5-large architectures, respectively. Additionally, our model boosts accuracy from 84.91\% to 91.54\% using the T5-base model and from 91.68\% to 92.77\% using the T5-large model over the state-of-the-art Multimodal-CoT on the ScienceQA test set. Experiments have shown that GoT achieves comparable results to Multimodal-CoT(large) with over 700M parameters, despite having fewer than 250M backbone model parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of GoT.},

  abstract = {An adaptive task difficulty assignment method which we reckon as balanced difficulty task finder (BDTF) is proposed in this paper. The aim is to recommend tasks to a learner using a trade-off between skills of the learner and difficulty of the tasks such that the learner experiences a state of flow during the learning. Flow is a mental state that psychologists refer to when someone is completely immersed in an activity. Flow state is a multidisciplinary field of research and has been studied not only in psychology, but also neuroscience, education, sport, and games. The idea behind this paper is to try to achieve a flow state in a similar way as Elo's chess skill rating (Glickman in Am Chess J 3:59-102) and TrueSkill (Herbrich et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, 2006) for matching game players, where "matched players" should possess similar capabilities and skills in order to maintain the level of motivation and involvement in the game. The BDTF draws analogy between choosing an appropriate opponent or appropriate game level and automatically choosing an appropriate difficulty level of a learning task. This method, as an intelligent tutoring system, could be used in a wide range of applications from online learning environments and e-learning, to learning and remembering techniques in traditional methods such as adjusting delayed matching to sample and spaced retrieval training that can be used for people with memory problems such as people with dementia.},

We show that conversational systems that leverage DialoGPT generate more relevant, contentful and context-consistent responses than strong baseline systems. The pre-trained model and training pipeline are publicly released to facilitate research into neural response generation and the development of more intelligent open-domain dialogue systems.},

There are many indications that the current fashionableness of the metaverse is not driven by technical factors, rather related to the public hype. To clarify the reasons for the increasing popularity of the concept, this study develops a model based on embodied social presence theory. We surveyed 292 metaverse users, and analyzed the obtained data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show that the main technical factors influencing the metaverse popularity do not significantly predict users' embodied presence and embodied co-presence, while users' imagination positively predicts their embodied presence in the metaverse and positively influences users' willingness to continuously participate through the multiple mediating effects of embodied presence and co-presence. The results of this study confirm, to some extent, that user imagination triggered by public opinion drives the popularity of the metaverse.}

Boson sampling is such a task and is considered a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We performed Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix-the whole optical setup is phase-locked-and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples were validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1014.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of Microsoft XiaoIce, the most popular social chatbot in the world. XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an AI companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) in system design, cast human-machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since her launch in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of large scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.},

  author = {Ziegenfuss, Donna H.},

  journal = {ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
  abstract = {Most research published on improving teaching practice and student learning outcomes in higher education focuses on how faculty approach the public act of teaching, not on how faculty privately design the instruction that they will implement in the classroom (Angelo \& Cross, 1993; Davis, 1993; McKeachie, 1994). Faculty receive little training in how to design instruction and teach when they are doctoral students. In addition, the literature indicates that when college faculty design courses, they do not follow systematic processes (Diamond, 1998; Hiscock, 1997; Richlin, 2006; Weimer, 2001). However, changing factors in higher education, especially increased emphasis on accountability and assessment, are revitalizing an interest in course design processes. Barr and Tagg (1995) use the phrase "shift from an instruction to a learning paradigm" to refer to changes they observe "taking hold" in higher education (p. 13). They state, "the Instruction Paradigm is to offer courses. In the Learning Paradigm, on the other hand, a college's purpose is not to transfer knowledge but to create environments and experiences that bring students to discover and construct knowledge for themselves" (p. 15). Conversely, Hiscock (1997) states, "There is no point in trying to advise faculty on how to improve their courses until it is known how they presently develop courses" (p. 216). Therefore, this exploratory study identifies and describes the variety of ways that faculty, at a single higher education institution, currently experience the process of designing courses. A qualitative methodology called phenomenography, that is designed to investigate variation in experiences, was selected for this study. The identification of five qualitatively different ways of conducting course design and three themes of expanding awareness fill gaps in the higher education course design literature and provide the foundation for future phenomenographic studies on course design. In addition, the findings provide educational developers with a better understanding and awareness of the course design process, which will prepare them to help faculty reflect on and enhance their approaches to course design and teaching.},

In this chapter, the author presents a cyclical phase analysis of self-regulation, identifies key self-regulatory processes used during each phase, and compares how skillful self-regulators differ from their classmates in the use of these processes. He also describes the social, environmental, and personal conditions from which self-regulation emerges and analyzes exemplary instructional models that have been used to develop students' self-regulatory skill.

  abstract = {Education in entrepreneurship has been receiving a re-assessment at higher education institutions over the past decade. Several problems have been identified in the delivery and contents of current entrepreneurship courses, and therefore both scholars and practitioners have called for a redesign of courses. We studied the development of a new entrepreneurship course through a descriptive chronological case study. By looking at the process of redesign it is evident the process was very similar to the Design Thinking problem solving methodology and we discuss the application of Design Thinking methodology in redesigning a novel action-based entrepreneurship course. The course design literature already states that prevailing analytical course design methods are not particularly suited to redesigning courses when no universally accepted strategies exist for achieving learning goals most effectively. Moreover, Design Thinking arguably addresses several problems of existing course design methods. This course design is marked by teaching teams rather than single teachers per class; by the students' engaging in practice rather than simply mastering theory and writing theoretical business plans; by students' being assigned a problem space rather than a narrowly defined problem; by involvement of industry coaches, partners, guest speakers; and by an emphasis on human-center edness. The general aim of this paper is to initiate a process of evaluating Design Thinking as a method of course design for possible use on different courses across disciplines and to explore how the approach fits into established course design approaches.},
