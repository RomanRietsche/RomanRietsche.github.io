abstract: 'While writing peer reviews resembles an important task in science, education,
  and large organizations, providing fruitful suggestions to peers is not a straightforward
  task, as different user interaction designs of text suggestion interfaces can have
  diverse effects on user behaviors when writing the review text. Generative language
  models might be able to support humans in formulating reviews with textual suggestions.
  Previous systems use two designs for providing text suggestions, but do not empirically
  evaluate them: inline and list of suggestions. To investigate the effects of embedding
  NLP text generation models in the two designs, we collected user requirements to
  implement Hamta as an example of assistants providing reviewers with text suggestions.
  Our experiment on comparing the two designs on 31 participants indicates that people
  using the inline interface provided longer reviews on average, while participants
  using the list of suggestions experienced more ease of use in using our tool. The
  results shed light on important design findings for embedding text generation models
  in user-centered assistants.'
