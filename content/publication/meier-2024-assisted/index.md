abstract: Creating and disseminating high-quality presentation slides have be come
  a foundation for effective communication in educational, corporate, and  scientific
  domains. This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the quality  of user-generated
  presentation content amidst the vast quantities of existing re sources. The study
  is concerned with an ongoing design science research project  that focuses on constructing
  a nascent design theory for a novel AI-based slide  evaluation support system (SESS)
  that aims to assist users, particularly educators,  create high-quality presentation
  slides. The proposed concept leverages recent  developments in Generative Artificial
  Intelligence (genAI) to analyze multi modal user-generated content. Drawing on signaling
  theory, user-generated  online reviews, and expert interviews, this research aims
  to contribute to deline ating the capabilities of artificial intelligence in digital
  content evaluation, spe cifically in assisting users to improve the quality of their
  presentation slides. For  practitioners, we offer a set of generalized design principles
  and design features  for the implementation in the development of an AI-based SESS.
