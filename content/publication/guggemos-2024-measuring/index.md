abstract: "Technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence, significantly
  transform our society and work practices. Computational thinking (CT) has emerged
  as a crucial 21st-century skill, enabling individuals to solve problems more effectively
  through an automation-oriented perspective and fundamental concepts of computer
  science. To ensure the effective integration of CT into educational curricula, it
  is crucial to develop efficient assessment frameworks that allow teachers to measure
  and promote student CT proficiency. Therefore, our aim is to develop a short test
  to measure CT among undergraduate students. To this end, we consider two performance
  tests: the Computational Thinking test (CTt) and the Algorithmic Thinking Test for
  Adults (ATTA). We use items from both instruments to compile a short test. Based
  on a sample of 290 second-year non-computer science undergraduate students, we provide
  evidence on the quality of our test. Besides classical test theory, we apply item
  response theory, namely Rasch modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis. Our test
  shows favorable properties, e.g., Cronbach's alpha $>$ .75, and may be suitable
  for the efficient assessment of CT across higher education programs."
