abstract: This paper delves into an advanced implementation of Chain-of-Thought-Prompting
  in Large Language Models, focusing on the use of tools (or \"plug-ins\") within
  the explicit reasoning paths generated by this prompting method. We find that tool-enabled
  conversational agents often become sidetracked, as additional context from tools
  like search engines or calculators diverts from original user intents. To address
  this, we explore a concept wherein the user becomes the tool, providing necessary
  details and refining their requests. Through Conversation Analysis, we characterize
  this interaction as insert-expansion - an intermediary conversation designed to
  facilitate the preferred response. We explore possibilities arising from this 'user-as-a-tool'
  approach in two empirical studies using direct comparison, and find benefits in
  the recommendation domain.
