abstract: The fast-paced acceleration of digitalization requires extensive re-&upskilling,
  impacting a significant proportion of jobs worldwide. Technology-mediated learning
  platforms have become instrumental in addressing these efforts, as they can analyze
  platform data to provide personalized learning journeys. Such personalization is
  expected to increase employees' empowerment, job satisfaction, and learning outcomes.
  However, the challenge lies in efficiently deploying these opportunities using novel
  technologies, prompting questions about the design and analysis of generating personalized
  learning paths in organizational learning. We, therefore, analyze and classify recent
  research on personalized learning paths into four major concepts (learning context,
  data, interface, and adaptation) with ten dimensions and 34 characteristics. Six
  expert interviews validate the taxonomy's use and outline three exemplary use cases,
  undermining its feasibility. Information Systems researchers can use our taxonomy
  to develop theoretical models to study the effectiveness of personalized learning
  paths in intra-organizational re-&upskilling.
