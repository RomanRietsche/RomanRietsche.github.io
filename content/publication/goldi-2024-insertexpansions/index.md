abstract: AI agents use language generation for internal reasoning and interacting
  with users. Agents often employ tools beyond language generation, such as calculators
  or search, to further augment these capabilities. We focus on how such tools can
  give the agent too much external context, diverting it from the user's original
  intent. According to Conversation Analysis, human-human dialogue often uses \"insert-expansion\"
  - inserted utterances for clarification - to resolve ambiguities. Building on this,
  we introduce a \"user-as-a-tool\" approach, enabling the AI agent to solicit clarification
  from the user while still reasoning, thereby realigning it with the user's intent.
  Initial evidence shows that our approach has benefits for conversational recommendation
  systems. We present a novel interaction method and empirical findings that enhance
  the user's role in guiding agent reasoning. This research is especially relevant
  as AI agents become increasingly common, and holds significance for optimizing the
  human-chatbot interaction loop.
